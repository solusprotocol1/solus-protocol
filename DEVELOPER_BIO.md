# About the Creator

## Nick Frankfort

Nick Frankfort is the creator, owner, and sole developer of S4 Ledger — a defense logistics verification product line of **S4 Systems, LLC**. S4 Ledger anchors tamper-proof audit trails on the XRP Ledger, providing the defense industry's first blockchain-verified integrity layer for supply chains, maintenance records, and contract deliverables.

Nick built the entire platform — 18 ILS tools, 21 SDK functions, 27 REST API endpoints, 25+ page website, and the $SLS utility token — at zero cost to the company, on his own time, as a working ILS contractor.

### Background

- Active ILS contractor with years of hands-on experience across Navy and DoW programs
- Proposed Product Lead / CTO for S4 Systems, LLC
- Expertise in Python, cryptography, distributed systems, and defense logistics workflows
- Deep understanding of defense supply chain challenges, maintenance record integrity, provisioning (PTD/ICAPS replacement), and configuration management

### What He Built

- **18 interactive ILS tools** covering every ILS element — readiness, DMSMS, lifecycle cost, provisioning, supply chain risk, predictive maintenance, contract management, audit reporting, and more
- **21 Python SDK functions** for defense-grade hash anchoring and verification
- **27 REST API endpoints** for enterprise integration
- **462 real defense platforms** across 9 military branches with real program data
- **156+ pre-built ILS record types** mapped to real-world logistics workflows
- **$SLS utility token** live on XRPL Mainnet (100M supply)
- **25+ page production website** at s4ledger.com

### Mission

To give the defense industry an integrity layer it can trust — immutable proof that logistics records are authentic, unaltered, and independently verifiable. S4 Ledger saves the government ~$600K–$1.6M per program per year and delivers 10–100x ROI at a fraction of the cost of Palantir, SAP, or Oracle solutions.
