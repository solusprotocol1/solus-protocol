# SEC & Regulatory Compliance Guidance

## Overview
S4 Ledger is a data integrity tool for defense logistics and $SLS is a utility token. The protocol is designed to avoid classification as a security under U.S. law.

## Key Points
- **Utility Token:** $SLS is used solely for anchoring fees on the S4 Ledger network. It does not represent equity, debt, or an investment contract.
- **No sensitive data on-chain:** No CUI, PII, ITAR, or defense data is ever stored on-chain, reducing regulatory risk.
- **Legal Opinions:** Legal review is planned for each major release.
- **KYC/AML:** No KYC/AML is required for protocol use, but may be required for certain exchanges.
- **Disclaimers:** All documentation and the SDK include clear disclaimers about non-investment status.

## Howey Test Analysis
- **Investment of money:** $SLS can be purchased, but it is consumed as fuel for anchoring — not held as an investment.
- **Common enterprise:** No pooled funds or profit-sharing mechanism exists.
- **Expectation of profit:** $SLS value derives from utility in the S4 Ledger network, not from speculative investment.
- **Efforts of others:** The token's utility is not dependent on S4 Ledger's managerial efforts.

## Guidance
- Consult with legal counsel before any token sale or exchange listing.
