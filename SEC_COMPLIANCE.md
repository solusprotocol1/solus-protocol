# SEC & Regulatory Compliance Guidance

## Overview
Solus Protocol is a data integrity tool and $SLS is a utility token. The protocol is designed to avoid classification as a security under U.S. law.

## Key Points
- **Utility Token:** $SLS is used solely for protocol fees, anchoring, and governance. It does not represent equity or an investment contract.
- **No PHI on-chain:** No personal or medical data is ever stored on-chain, reducing regulatory risk.
- **Legal Opinions:** Legal review is planned for each major release and before mainnet launch.
- **KYC/AML:** No KYC/AML is required for protocol use, but may be required for certain exchanges.
- **Disclaimers:** All documentation and the SDK include clear disclaimers about non-investment status.

## Guidance
- Consult with legal counsel before any token sale or exchange listing.
- Monitor SEC and CFTC guidance for updates.
