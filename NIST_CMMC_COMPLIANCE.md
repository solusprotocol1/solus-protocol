# NIST & CMMC Compliance Documentation

## Overview

S4 Ledger is designed to align with NIST SP 800-171 and CMMC Level 2 requirements. **S4 Systems, LLC is pursuing CMMC Level 2 certification.** The hash-only architecture ensures that no Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), Covered Defense Information (CDI), or sensitive data is ever stored on-chain.

## Hash-Only Architecture

- **Data Minimization:** Only SHA-256 hashes are anchored to the XRP Ledger — never original data
- **Irreversibility:** SHA-256 hashes cannot be reversed to recover the source data
- **CUI Protection:** No CUI leaves the customer's network boundary
- **ITAR/EAR Safe:** No technical data is transmitted or stored on the blockchain

## NIST SP 800-171 Alignment

| Control Family | S4 Ledger Alignment |
|---|---|
| 3.1 Access Control | No CUI accessible — hash-only |
| 3.3 Audit & Accountability | Immutable, timestamped audit trail on XRPL |
| 3.4 Configuration Management | Configuration baseline anchoring |
| 3.5 Identification & Authentication | XRPL wallet-based authentication |
| 3.13 System & Communications Protection | TLS 1.3 encryption on all connections |
| 3.14 System & Information Integrity | Core service — integrity verification |

## CMMC Level 2 Alignment

S4 Systems, LLC is pursuing CMMC Level 2 certification. S4 Ledger provides the following CMMC-aligned controls:

- Immutable proof of record integrity (Practice AU.L2-3.3.1)
- Tamper-evident audit trails (Practice AU.L2-3.3.2)
- Configuration baseline verification (Practice CM.L2-3.4.1)
- Independent integrity verification using public ledger

## DFARS 252.204-7012

Since S4 Ledger does not receive, store, or process Covered Defense Information (CDI), DFARS CDI protection requirements do not apply to the hashed data on the XRP Ledger.
