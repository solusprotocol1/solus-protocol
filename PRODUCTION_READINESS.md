# S4 Ledger — Production Readiness Checklist

> **Status:** Production ($SLS LIVE on XRPL Mainnet) — **Estimated ~96% Production Ready**  
> **Last Updated:** February 2026 (v4.0.4)  
> **Target:** First enterprise pilot — $SLS LIVE on Mainnet

> **Note:** S4 Ledger operates as a product line of S4 Systems, LLC. Many corporate infrastructure items below (CAGE Code, SAM.gov, EIN, D-U-N-S, legal counsel, compliance posture) may already be in place through S4 Systems. Items marked 🟡 should be verified with S4 Systems leadership rather than obtained from scratch. Nick Frankfort leads product/technology; S4 Systems provides business development, legal, compliance, hiring, and corporate infrastructure.
