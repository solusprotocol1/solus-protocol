# Confirmation

Yes, with the current `solus_sdk.py` and these scenarios, medical providers and patients can anchor (store) hashes of medical data on the XRPL using $SLS. The SDK:
- Hashes the record,
- Attempts to pay a micro-fee in $SLS (if trust lines are set up),
- Falls back to recording the hash as a memo on the XRPL (AccountSet) if needed.

This ensures the data hash is immutably recorded on-chain, and the code is ready for real-world prototype use.
