# S4 Ledger — Subscription & Onboarding Guide

**The blockchain-powered ILS platform built for defense logistics.**

> Every record anchored. Every decision proven. Every audit ready.

---

## What Is S4 Ledger?

S4 Ledger is a defense logistics platform that anchors Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) records to the XRP Ledger — creating immutable, timestamped proof of every provisioning decision, compliance milestone, CDRL delivery, and DMSMS resolution.

Instead of filing records in spreadsheets that can be altered, lost, or disputed, S4 Ledger hashes each record (SHA-256) and writes that hash to a public blockchain. The result: **tamper-proof audit trails that satisfy DCMA, DLA, C3PAO, and IG inspections instantly.**

---

## How It Works

```
1. You upload or create a logistics record (CDRL, parts data, readiness calculation, etc.)
2. S4 Ledger generates a SHA-256 hash of that record
3. The hash is anchored to the XRP Ledger via an XRPL Memo transaction
4. You receive an immutable XRPL transaction ID as proof
5. Anyone can verify the record's integrity at any time — no logins required
```

**Cost per anchor: 0.01 SLS** (our utility token on the XRP Ledger)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to buy SLS tokens separately?**
No. SLS tokens are included with your subscription and delivered automatically from the S4 Treasury. There is no exchange or trading involved.

**Q: What happens if I run out of SLS?**
You can purchase additional SLS top-offs through the platform, or upgrade your subscription tier. SLS does not expire — unused tokens roll over.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
Yes. All document processing happens client-side in your browser. Only SHA-256 hashes (not the original data) are anchored to the XRPL. Hashes cannot be reversed to reveal the original content.

**Q: Can I downgrade or cancel?**
Yes. You can change tiers or cancel at any time. Existing anchored records remain on the XRPL permanently — they are immutable.

**Q: What file formats are supported?**
CSV, XLSX, XLS, PDF, DOCX, TXT, TSV, XML, and JSON. All are parsed client-side using open-source libraries (SheetJS, pdf.js, mammoth.js).

**Q: Do I need a CAC to use S4 Ledger?**
No. S4 Ledger is a commercial SaaS platform. For organizations that require CAC authentication, Enterprise tier includes custom SSO/IdP integration support.
