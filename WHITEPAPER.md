# Solus Protocol Whitepaper
**Decentralized Infrastructure for Medical Data Integrity** *Version 2.1 | January 2026*

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Solus Protocol ($SLS) provides a decentralized, immutable layer for the verification and anchoring of healthcare data. Built on the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**, Solus enables healthcare providers, clinical researchers, and patients to ensure the integrity of medical records through cryptographic hashing. By removing the possibility of retroactive data manipulation, Solus establishes a "Gold Standard" for trust in digital health.

## 2. The Problem: Data Fragmentation and Manipulation
Current Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and clinical trial databases suffer from two critical vulnerabilities:
1. **Centralization:** Data stored in centralized silos is susceptible to unauthorized alteration and cyberattacks.
2. **Lack of Auditability:** Retroactive changes to clinical trial results or patient history can be difficult to detect, compromising patient safety and regulatory compliance.

## 3. The Solution: Solus Protocol
Solus leverages the high speed and low cost of the XRP Ledger to create a permanent audit trail.
- **Data Anchoring:** Instead of storing sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) on-chain, Solus stores a unique cryptographic hash of the data.
- **Verification:** Any party with the original document can verify its authenticity by comparing its hash against the one anchored on the Solus Protocol.

## 4. Tokenomics ($SLS)
The $SLS token is the native utility asset of the Solus ecosystem. It is used to fuel data anchoring operations and govern the protocol's development.

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Token Name** | Solus Protocol |
| **Symbol** | $SLS |
| **Network** | XRP Ledger (XRPL) |
| **Issuer Address** | `r95GyZac4butvVcsTWUPpxzekmyzaHsTA5` |
| **Total Supply** | 100,000,000 SLS |
