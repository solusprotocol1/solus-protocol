## <center>**LEGAL NOTICE AND RISK DISCLOSURE**</center>

> [!WARNING]
> **IMPORTANT:**
> **PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY.**
> 
> THE ACQUISITION OF SLS TOKENS INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISK AND SHOULD ONLY BE UNDERTAKEN BY INDIVIDUALS CAPABLE OF BEARING THE TOTAL LOSS OF THEIR PURCHASE.

**1. REGULATORY AND SECURITIES LAW RISK**

The legal status of **SLS** and the **Solus Protocol** is subject to rapid change. While the project is designed as a utility-based network token, there is a material risk that the **SEC**, **CFTC**, or other global authorities may deem SLS a "security" under the *Howey Test* or similar frameworks. 
* **Managerial Efforts:** The value of SLS is intended to be derived from decentralized network demand; however, regulatory bodies may view the initial development efforts by the Solus team as "essential managerial efforts," potentially triggering registration requirements under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. 
* **Consequences:** Such a determination could result in the delisting of SLS from decentralized exchanges (DEXs), enforcement actions, and a total loss of token liquidity and utility.

**2. TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORK RELIANCE**

Solus Protocol is built on the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**. 
* **Third-Party Dependency:** The protocol has no control over the underlying consensus mechanism or the operational status of the XRPL. Malfunctions, "hard forks," or 51% attacks on the XRPL would directly impact the integrity of anchored hashes.
* **Smart Contract Risk:** Despite audits, the programmatic code used for data anchoring and verification may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities. Exploits could lead to the permanent loss of $SLS or the corruption of clinical audit trails.

**3. MARKET VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY**

$SLS is not a stablecoin and is not backed by fiat currency or physical assets. 
* **Price Fluctuations:** The market price of SLS is subject to extreme swings based on speculation, regulatory news, and broader crypto-market trends. 
* **DEX Interaction:** Users trade $SLS on third-party decentralized platforms (Sologenic, xMagnetic, XPMarket). Solus Protocol is not responsible for the security, performance, or regulatory compliance of these independent trading environments.

**4. LIMITATION OF RIGHTS AND NO EQUITY**

$SLS tokens do not represent an investment, debt, or proprietary interest in any entity. 
* **No Financial Claims:** Holders possess no rights to dividends, profit-sharing, or residual assets in the event of a project liquidation. 
* **Governance Limitations:** Any voting rights granted to holders are limited to protocol-level technical parameters and do not constitute control over a corporate board or business strategy.

**5. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This document contains "forward-looking statements" regarding the 2026–2031 Roadmap. These are based on current technical goals and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially due to technological hurdles, shifts in HIPAA/GDPR compliance requirements, or lack of global healthcare adoption.

**Cross-chain interoperability features (e.g., direct token bridging to XRPL EVM via Axelar) are in active development and subject to third-party infrastructure support.**

## <center>1. Executive Summary</center>

Solus Protocol ($SLS) provides a decentralized, immutable layer for the verification and anchoring of healthcare data. Built on the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**, Solus enables healthcare providers, patients, and clinical researchers to ensure the integrity of medical records through cryptographic hashing. 

By leveraging the XRPL's high-speed consensus, Solus establishes a "Gold Standard" for trust. The protocol does not store sensitive Protected Health Information (PHI) on-chain; instead, it anchors a unique cryptographic "fingerprint" (SHA-256) of the data. This allows any authorized party to prove a document has not been altered since its creation without exposing private details to the public.

**As of February 2026**, Solus Protocol has delivered a production-ready ecosystem comprising:
- A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — a fully functional mobile healthcare data wallet supporting three user roles (Patient, Provider, EHR Administrator)
- A **Python SDK** for programmatic data anchoring and verification against the XRPL
- A **Live Metrics API** reading real-time transaction data from the XRPL Testnet
- **Real-time XRPL Testnet integration** with verifiable on-chain transaction explorer links
- A **CLI tool** for command-line hash anchoring and validation
- Over **25 categorized medical record types** with live chain-verified anchoring

## <center>2. The Problem: The "Silent" Vulnerability of Health Data</center>

Current Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are centralized silos vulnerable to four specific failures:

### 2.1 Administrative Tampering & "God-Mode"
Standard databases allow users with high-level administrative access to alter entries. In clinical trials or legal disputes, there is no way for an external auditor to mathematically prove that a record was not back-dated or modified to hide a medical error or unfavorable trial result.

### 2.2 The Verification Gap in Data Exchange
When a patient moves from a General Practitioner to a Specialist, the data is transmitted via insecure or centralized channels. "Provider B" has no automated way to verify that the file received is a bit-for-bit match of the original file generated by "Provider A."

### 2.3 Regulatory Burden & Audit Fatigue
HIPAA/HITECH audits are currently manual, slow, and expensive. Providers struggle to produce "Proof of Integrity" that satisfies modern forensic standards, leading to significant legal liability during data breaches or malpractice claims.

### 2.4 Patient Disempowerment
Patients have limited control over their medical records. They rely on providers to manage, share, and protect their data. There is no patient-facing solution that provides a transparent view of data custody, access logs, or integrity verification.

## <center>3. The Solution: Solus Protocol</center>
Solus provides a **Layer-2 Integrity Framework** that uses the XRP Ledger as a universal "Truth Layer."

### 3.1 Immutable Data Anchoring
When a medical record is generated, Solus creates a **SHA-256 Hash**. This hash is irreversible and unique. The protocol then submits this hash to the XRPL via a memo-encoded transaction. Once confirmed, the timestamp and hash are permanent. The Solus SDK supports explicit record-type prefixing (e.g., `SURGERY:hash`, `VITALS:hash`) for structured categorization of over 25 medical record types including Vitals, Lab Results, Imaging, Surgery, Prescriptions, Immunizations, Emergency, Mental Health, Telemedicine, Pediatric, Post-Op Monitoring, Chronic Care, Preventive Care, and more.

### 3.2 Real-Time Integrity Auditing
Any authorized auditor can use the Solus API to compare a current medical file against its on-chain anchor. If even one byte of the file has been altered, the verification will fail, providing an immediate red flag for data corruption or unauthorized tampering. The Solus Metrics API provides live dashboards showing total records anchored, fee expenditure, record type distribution, daily/monthly trends, and an individual activity feed — all sourced directly from real XRPL Testnet data.

### 3.3 Zero-Knowledge Privacy & "Safe Harbor"
Because only the hash is stored, Solus satisfies the **HIPAA Safe Harbor** method for de-identification. The protocol remains "content-agnostic," meaning it secures the *validity* of the data without ever needing to "see" the patient's personal information.

### 3.4 Multi-Role Access Architecture
Solus implements a role-based access system with three distinct user types:
- **Patient:** Manage personal health records, grant/revoke provider access, view blockchain verification status, share records via QR code or direct link, and track data custody.
- **Healthcare Provider:** Anchor clinical records, verify incoming patient data, perform bulk anchoring operations, look up patient records by identifier, and request access to patient data.
- **EHR Administrator:** Manage institutional anchoring, perform system-wide data integrity verification, oversee compliance dashboards, and conduct bulk record operations.

## <center>4. Technical Architecture</center>

### 4.1 Solus Protocol SDK (Python)
The open-source Python SDK (`solus_sdk.py`) provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with the Solus Protocol. Key capabilities include:

| Function | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `hash_record(data)` | Generate a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of any data input |
| `anchor_hash(hash, record_type)` | Anchor a hash to the XRPL with memo-encoded record type |
| `verify_hash(hash)` | Verify a hash against its XRPL anchor |
| `get_anchored_records()` | Retrieve all anchored records from a specific account |
| `encrypt_data(data)` | AES-256 Fernet encryption for data at rest |
| `decrypt_data(token)` | Decrypt previously encrypted data |
| `fiat_conversion(amount)` | Real-time $SLS to USD/EUR conversion |

The SDK supports both live XRPL Mainnet and Testnet environments, with automatic fallback to mock mode for development and testing.

### 4.2 Metrics & Analytics API
A production-ready Flask API (`metrics_api.py`) serves real-time analytics from the XRPL Testnet:

- **`/metrics` endpoint:** Returns total hashes anchored, fee expenditure, record type distribution, daily/monthly hashing trends, and an individual record-level activity feed.
- **`/transactions` endpoint:** Returns a paginated list of all Solus anchoring transactions with explorer URLs.
- **Record Categorization Engine:** Automatically classifies anchored records into 25+ medical record types using both explicit prefix matching and intelligent keyword-based fallback.
- **CORS-enabled** for cross-origin frontend consumption.
- **Hosted on Render** at `https://solusprotocol.onrender.com/metrics` for public access.

### 4.3 CLI Tool
The Solus CLI (`solus_cli.py`) enables command-line anchoring and verification:
```
solus anchor --data "patient_vitals_2026-02-07" --type VITALS
solus verify --hash 0x7f8a9b2c3d4e...
solus records --account rJPqcx8wUBM58aj...
```

### 4.4 XRPL Testnet Integration
All Solus anchoring operations are submitted to the XRPL Testnet with full transparency:
- **Testnet Account:** `rJPqcx8wUBM58ajPUoz1dReKkTT6hqrqJA`
- **Explorer Verification:** Every anchored record links directly to `https://testnet.xrpl.org` for independent on-chain verification.
- **Memo-Encoded Hashes:** SHA-256 hashes are stored in XRPL transaction memos, ensuring they are permanently readable by any XRPL client.

## <center>6. Tokenomics ($SLS)</center>

The $SLS token is the native utility asset of the Solus ecosystem.

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Token Name** | Solus Protocol |
| **Symbol** | $SLS |
| **Network** | XRP Ledger (XRPL) |
| **Issuer Address** | `r95GyZac4butvVcsTWUPpxzekmyzaHsTA5` |
| **Total Supply** | 100,000,000 SLS (maximum issued; no additional minting without owner action) |
| **Circulating/Issued Supply** | ~69,999,909 SLS (current on XRPL Mainnet; Base ERC-20 representation aligned via burn) |
| **Liquidity** | **Decentralized AMM Pools Enabled** |
| **Utility** | Data Anchoring, Validation, Governance |

**Supply Note:** The protocol initially minted 100,000,000 SLS on Base for the EVM representation. Excess supply was burned to align with the current issued/circulating amount on XRPL Mainnet (~69,999,909 SLS). No further minting is planned without governance or owner action.

### Token Utility Breakdown
- **Anchoring Fees:** Each SHA-256 hash anchored to the XRPL consumes a small $SLS fee, creating sustainable demand.
- **Verification Rebates:** Users who perform record verifications receive small $SLS rebates, incentivizing ecosystem participation.
- **Governance Voting:** Token holders can vote on protocol parameters, fee structures, and Compliance Improvement Proposals.
- **Grant Allocation:** A portion of the ecosystem fund supports open-source developers building EHR integrations.

### Cross-Chain Interoperability
Solus Protocol is expanding to EVM-compatible environments, including a verified ERC-20 representation on Base Mainnet and interchain setup on the XRPL EVM Sidechain via Axelar. Direct $SLS token bridging (mainnet IOU and Base ERC-20) is in active development with Axelar and Peersyst teams to enable full custom token support. Value transfer and swaps on Base are available now.

### Trading Venues

## <center>10. HIPAA Regulatory Alignment & Technical Safeguards</center>

Solus Protocol is engineered to serve as a **Technical Safeguard** for Covered Entities and Business Associates. The protocol's architecture directly addresses the implementation specifications of the **HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR § 164.312)** and the **2021 HITECH Act Amendment**.

Solus Protocol is engineered to meet the "Privacy-by-Design" requirements of the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**.

### <center>A. Data De-Identification, Transmission & Storage Security (Safe Harbor) (§ 164.312(e)(1))</center>
- **HIPAA Safe Harbor Compliance:** Solus **does not store** PHI on the blockchain. By anchoring only de-identified hashes, providers separate the *content* of the record from the *integrity proof*, minimizing the "breach surface area."
Solus **does not store** Protected Health Information (PHI) on the blockchain. 
- **Hashed Anchoring:** The protocol only records SHA-256 cryptographic hashes. These are irreversible "fingerprints" that cannot be used to reconstruct patient data.
- **Off-Chain Sovereignty:** Actual medical records remain in the secure, HIPAA-compliant databases of the healthcare provider.

### <center>B. Audit Controls & Accountability (§ 164.312(b))</center>
- **Immutable Audit Trails:** Solus anchors activity logs to the XRP Ledger, creating a permanent history of data custody.
- **Non-Repudiation:** Each transaction is cryptographically signed, ensuring that data verification events are legally defensible.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** The Metrics API provides continuous visibility into anchoring activity, enabling compliance officers to monitor data integrity operations in real time.

### <center>C. Integrity Controls (§ 164.312(c)(1))</center>
Solus implements **Cryptographic Meta-Sealing** (SHA-256) to protect ePHI from improper alteration. 
- **Liability Mitigation:** Under the 2021 HITECH Amendment, Solus provides the "verifiable proof" of recognized security practices required to mitigate regulatory fines during a data breach investigation.
- **Multi-Role Access Control:** The mobile wallet enforces role-based access (Patient, Provider, EHR), ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions on records.

### <center>D. Data Encryption & Transmission Security</center>
- **AES-256 Fernet Encryption:** The Solus SDK provides built-in encryption/decryption functions for data at rest using the `cryptography` library.
- **TLS 1.3:** All API communications between the mobile wallet, Metrics API, and XRPL nodes use TLS 1.3 encryption.
- **Zero-Knowledge On-Chain:** Only irreversible SHA-256 hashes are transmitted to the XRPL; no PHI is ever sent over the wire to the blockchain.

---

## <center>APPENDIX A: Business Associate Agreement (BAA) Summary</center>
1. **Permitted Uses:** Business Associate (Solus Service Provider) may use PHI only for data anchoring and verification services as defined in the service agreement.
2. **Safeguards:** Business Associate shall implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards (including AES-256 encryption and TLS 1.3) that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality and integrity of ePHI.
3. **Breach Reporting:** Business Associate shall notify the Covered Entity within **24 hours** of any successful security incident or unauthorized access to the anchored data environment.
4. **Subcontractors:** Any subcontractors must enter into a written agreement with the Business Associate that contains the same restrictions as this BAA.
5. **Termination:** Upon termination, all PHI must be returned or destroyed; however, cryptographic hashes anchored to the XRPL remain immutable and do not contain PHI.

## <center>APPENDIX B: Compliance Checklist</center>
- [ ] **No PHI On-Chain:** Ensure no PHI (names, SSNs, DOB) is included in the "extra data" field of the XRPL transaction. Only SHA-256 hashes should be anchored.
- [ ] **Key Management:** Implement a HIPAA-compliant HSM (Hardware Security Module) to manage the private keys used for Solus anchoring transactions.
- [ ] **Access Control:** Map internal EHR user roles to Solus API keys to maintain a clear audit trail of who anchored which record.
- [ ] **Audit Review:** Conduct monthly reviews of the on-chain audit trail against internal EHR logs to verify data consistency.

## <center>APPENDIX C: Supported Medical Record Types</center>
The Solus Protocol SDK and Metrics API support automatic categorization of the following medical record types:

| Category | Record Types |
|:---|:---|
| **Clinical** | Vitals, Lab Results, Imaging, Surgery, Prescriptions, Clinical Notes |
| **Emergency & Acute** | Emergency, Discharge, Post-Op Monitoring |
| **Preventive & Chronic** | Immunization, Preventive Care, Chronic Care, Care Plan |
| **Specialty** | Mental Health, Telemedicine, Pediatric, Allergies |
| **Administrative** | Referral, Consent, Patient Message, Administrative, EHR Integration |

Each record type is prefixed in the XRPL memo data (e.g., `SURGERY:sha256hash`) for structured on-chain categorization and downstream analytics.
