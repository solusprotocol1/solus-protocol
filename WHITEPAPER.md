## **LEGAL NOTICE AND RISK DISCLOSURE FOR SOLUS PROTOCOL (SLS)**

> [!WARNING]
> **IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY.** THE ACQUISITION OF SLS TOKENS INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISK AND SHOULD ONLY BE UNDERTAKEN BY INDIVIDUALS CAPABLE OF BEARING THE TOTAL LOSS OF THEIR PURCHASE.

**1. REGULATORY AND LEGAL STATUS** The legal and regulatory status of **SLS** and the **Solus Protocol** in the United States and globally is uncertain and subject to rapid change. There is a risk that the **SEC**, **CFTC**, or **FinCEN** may deem SLS a "security" or a regulated financial instrument. Such a determination could subject the **Solus Protocol** issuers to enforcement actions and registration requirements, which could result in a total loss of liquidity and utility for SLS holders.

**2. VOLATILITY AND MARKET RISKS** The value of **SLS** is subject to extreme market volatility. Significant price declines, fraud, market manipulation, and operational failures on third-party trading platforms can lead to a sudden and permanent loss of value. **SLS** is not a stablecoin and is not pegged to any fiat currency or physical asset.

**3. CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY** The **Solus Protocol** relies on complex smart contract code. Despite security audits, vulnerabilities may exist. Risks include malicious attacks, protocol failures, and the risk of **private key theft**. If you lose your private keys or your wallet is compromised, the **Solus Protocol** has no mechanism to recover your **SLS** tokens. Smart contract code for the protocol may be filed as an exhibit to public disclosures where required by law.

**4. LIMITATION OF RIGHTS** **SLS** tokens do not represent equity, shares, or any ownership interest in the **Solus Protocol** or any associated company. Holders have no rights to profits, dividends, or corporate voting. Governance is limited strictly to protocol-level decisions (e.g., on-chain votes) as defined in the **Solus Protocol** technical documentation.

**5. DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND OPERATIONS** The **Solus Protocol** is currently in its development stage. Future plans and revenue models are subject to change. The protocol may rely on third-party service providers or counterparties; any failure by these parties could disrupt the functionality of **SLS**. There is no guarantee that the project’s roadmap will be fully realized.

## 1. Executive Summary
Solus Protocol ($SLS) provides a decentralized, immutable layer for the verification and anchoring of healthcare data. Built on the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**, Solus enables healthcare providers, clinical researchers, and patients to ensure the integrity of medical records through cryptographic hashing. By removing the possibility of retroactive data manipulation, Solus establishes a "Gold Standard" for trust in digital health.

## 2. The Problem: Data Fragmentation and Manipulation
Current Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems suffer from two critical vulnerabilities:
1. **Centralization:** Data stored in centralized silos is susceptible to unauthorized alteration.
2. **Lack of Auditability:** Retroactive changes to clinical records are difficult to detect, compromising patient safety and regulatory compliance.

## 3. The Solution: Solus Protocol
Solus leverages the high speed and low cost of the XRPL to create a permanent audit trail.
- **Data Anchoring:** Instead of storing sensitive patient data on-chain, Solus stores a unique cryptographic hash.
- **Verification:** Any party with the original document can verify its authenticity by comparing its hash against the one anchored on the Solus Protocol.

## 4. Tokenomics ($SLS)
The $SLS token is the native utility asset of the Solus ecosystem.

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Token Name** | Solus Protocol |
| **Symbol** | $SLS |
| **Network** | XRP Ledger (XRPL) |
| **Issuer Address** | `r95GyZac4butvVcsTWUPpxzekmyzaHsTA5` |
| **Total Supply** | 100,000,000 SLS |
| **Liquidity** | **Decentralized AMM Pools Enabled** |
| **Utility** | Data Anchoring, Validation, Governance |

### **LEGAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SLS TOKEN**
The SLS Token is designed and intended to function as a **"Network Token"** or **"Digital Tool"** within the **Solus Protocol** ecosystem. It is not an investment, a security, a commodity, or any other kind of financial instrument. The following factors support the characterization of SLS as a utility asset rather than a security:

* **Consumptive Use & Functionality:** SLS provides holders with programmatic access to the decentralized services and computational resources provided by the **Solus Protocol**. The primary purpose of acquiring SLS is for consumption and interaction within the ecosystem, not for passive speculative gain.
* **No Expectation of Profit from Managerial Efforts:** The value and utility of SLS are derived from the programmatic operation and decentralized demand for the **Solus Protocol** network. While the initial developers have contributed to the codebase, the ongoing utility of the token is tied to the collective performance of independent network participants and the open-source protocol.
* **Decentralized Governance:** Governance rights associated with SLS are limited to protocol-level adjustments and parameter voting within the **Solus Protocol**. These rights do not grant any ownership in a corporate entity, nor do they entitle holders to dividends, profit-sharing, or the selection of corporate directors.
* **Fixed Utility, Not Equity:** SLS does not represent a claim on the assets of the **Solus Protocol** developers or any associated legal entity. In the event of a liquidation of any supporting entity, SLS holders have no rights to the residual value of that entity's assets.
* **Marketing Focus:** SLS is marketed solely on its functional utility and its role as a necessary component for interacting with the **Solus Protocol**. The project does not promote SLS as an investment vehicle or suggest that it will increase in value based on the developers' profit-generating activities.

### **Solus Protocol Utility vs. Security Comparison**

| Feature | SLS Token (Utility Model) | Traditional Security |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Purpose** | Access to **Solus Protocol** services | Financial return / Investment |
| **Governance** | On-chain protocol parameters | Corporate board / Strategy voting |
| **Economic Right** | Functional usage value | Dividends / Share of profits |
| **Source of Value** | Decentralized network demand | Managerial efforts of a company |
| **Issuer Obligation** | Maintain the **Solus Protocol** code | Generate profit for shareholders |

## 7. HIPAA Alignment & Data Privacy Standards
Solus Protocol is engineered to meet the "Privacy-by-Design" requirements of the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**.

### A. Data De-Identification (Safe Harbor)
Solus **does not store** Protected Health Information (PHI) on the blockchain. 
- **Hashed Anchoring:** The protocol only records SHA-256 cryptographic hashes. These are irreversible "fingerprints" that cannot be used to reconstruct patient data.
- **Off-Chain Sovereignty:** Actual medical records remain in the secure, HIPAA-compliant databases of the healthcare provider.

### B. Auditability & Technical Safeguards
- **Integrity Controls:** The immutable nature of the XRPL ensures that once a hash is anchored, it cannot be retroactively altered.
- **Audit Logs:** Every anchoring transaction is time-stamped and signed, providing an unforgeable audit trail for clinical researchers and regulators.
