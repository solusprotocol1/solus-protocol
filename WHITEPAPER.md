# Solus Protocol (SLS) Whitepaper
**Version:** 1.0  
**Network:** XRP Ledger (XRPL)  
**Issuer Address:** `r95GyZac4butvVcsTWUPpxzekmyzaHsTA5`

## 1. Abstract
Solus Protocol is a decentralized utility asset built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). It is designed to provide a low-latency, highly scalable foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) and automated market participation. By utilizing the XRPL's native LS20 Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol, Solus ensures transparent liquidity and efficient transaction finality without the need for centralized intermediaries.

## 2. Technical Infrastructure
Solus Protocol is built natively on the XRP Ledger to leverage its institutional-grade security and settlement speed.
* **Native AMM Integration:** SLS utilizes the XRPL native AMM, allowing for decentralized trading and liquidity provision with a fixed 0.5% trading fee.
* **Dual-Wallet Architecture:** The protocol maintains a clear separation between the **Issuer Wallet (Cold)** and **Operational Wallet (Hot)** to ensure maximum security of the token supply.
* **Domain Verification:** The protocol utilizes XLS-32 standards for domain verification via `raw.githubusercontent.com` to establish trust and project identity.

## 3. Tokenomics & Utility
* **Total Supply:** 100,000,000 SLS
* **Token Type:** Utility Asset
* **Core Utility:** 1. **Governance:** SLS holders may participate in future protocol parameter votes.
    2. **Liquidity Incentives:** Users providing liquidity to the SLS/XRP pool receive a proportional share of trading fees.
    3. **Ecosystem Access:** Future dApp integrations within the Solus ecosystem will utilize SLS as a primary access and reward token.

## 4. Roadmap (2026)
* **Q1:** Genesis and Initial AMM Deployment.
* **Q2:** Verification on primary XRPL trackers (XPMarket, Magnetic, XRPScan).
* **Q3:** Community expansion and first-tier utility integrations.
* **Q4:** Exploration of bridge integrations and expanded DEX presence.

## 5. Security & Compliance
Solus Protocol is committed to transparency. All issuer settings, including the `DefaultRipple` flag and transaction history, are publicly verifiable. The project does not conduct a public sale or initial coin offering (ICO); liquidity is established through open market participation on the decentralized exchange.
