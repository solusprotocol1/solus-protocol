# S4 Ledger — Production Readiness Checklist

> **Status:** Production ($SLS LIVE on XRPL Mainnet) — **Estimated ~96% MVP/Pilot Ready | ~85% Enterprise Production Ready**  
> **Last Updated:** February 2026 (v5.12.0)  
> **Target:** First enterprise pilot — $SLS LIVE on Mainnet

> **Note:** S4 Ledger operates as a product line of S4 Systems, LLC. Many corporate infrastructure items below (CAGE Code, SAM.gov, EIN, D-U-N-S, legal counsel, compliance posture) may already be in place through S4 Systems. Items marked 🟡 should be verified with S4 Systems leadership rather than obtained from scratch. Nick Frankfort leads product/technology; S4 Systems provides business development, legal, compliance, hiring, and corporate infrastructure.

## v12 Production Updates (2026-02-22)
- 20+ ILS tools (added SBOM Viewer)
- 34 Navy programs across 11 categories
- AI Threat Scoring, Failure Timeline, Digital Thread, Collaboration, Zero-Trust Watermark
- All charts now reactive to input changes
- Offline queue pulls from real vault records

## v5.11.x Production Updates (2026-02-25)

### v5.11.1 — Persistence, Utility Token, Demo/Prod Separation
- [x] **Supabase State Sync Engine** — Full localStorage → Supabase persistence in prod-app. Every user interaction (uploads, edits, drag-reorder, theme, vault, settings) automatically syncs to PostgreSQL. 46 localStorage keys tracked, 45 synced (only `_hc` health check excluded). Debounced 2s flush, beforeunload sendBeacon fallback.
- [x] **100% Persistence Coverage Verified** — Every localStorage key in prod-app confirmed caught by PERSIST_KEYS list + `startsWith('s4_')` / `startsWith('s4V')` / `startsWith('s4A')` / `startsWith('s4N')` pattern matching.
- [x] **Demo-App Supabase Removal** — Removed entire Supabase state sync engine from demo-app. Demo data is ephemeral (localStorage only, no cloud sync). This is intentional — demo data is not real.
- [x] **SEC Howey Test Analysis** — Full prong-by-prong utility token determination in SEC_COMPLIANCE.md. $SLS fails all 4 Howey prongs. Added regulatory posture table, comparable precedents, ongoing compliance commitments.
- [x] **CEO Launch Costs Document** — CEO_LAUNCH_COSTS.md with cost breakdown, Howey summary, revenue projections, competitive matrix, ROI timeline.
- [x] **AI Cascade Verified** — Azure OpenAI (FedRAMP) → OpenAI GPT-4o → Anthropic Claude Sonnet → client-side fallback. No conflicts, clean waterfall.
- [x] **Demo SLS Flow Verified** — _initDemoSession() → /api/demo/provision → _animateDemoSteps() → offline fallback with tier-based allocation. Anchor fees (0.01 SLS), metrics, tx log all functional.
- [x] **Enter Platform Routing** — All public pages (index, metrics, transactions, 404, SDK, investors, etc.) route to /demo-app/. Zero /prod-app/ links on public-facing pages.

### v5.11.0 — Supabase Integration, Link Routing, Doc Audit
- [x] **Removed Production/Demo badges** from both apps
- [x] **All /prod-app/ links** changed to /demo-app/ across 17+ HTML pages
- [x] **Supabase state sync engine** added to prod-app
- [x] **Custom program persistence** (localStorage)
- [x] **/api/state/save and /api/state/load** endpoints added
- [x] **user_state migration SQL** (supabase/migrations/005_user_state_table.sql)
- [x] **50+ markdown docs audited** — tool counts (20+), branches (Navy/USMC/USCG), CMMC L2-ready, FedRAMP/IL4
