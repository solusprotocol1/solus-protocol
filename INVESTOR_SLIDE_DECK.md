# S4 Ledger: Investor Slide Deck

---

## Vision
S4 Ledger: Immutable logistics verification for the defense industry, anchored on XRPL, powered by $SLS.

---

## Problem
- Counterfeit parts, falsified maintenance records, unverifiable supply chains
- No common integrity layer across DoD logistics systems
- Siloed data, audit failures, delivery disputes

---

## Solution
- Anchor only SHA-256 hashes (never sensitive data) to XRPL
- Zero data on-chain — NIST/CMMC compliant
- 3-5s confirmation, ~$0.001 per anchor

---

## Traction
- Live $SLS token on XRPL mainnet
- Working Python SDK
- Defense use case library
- s4ledger.com — 9 pages

---

## Market
- $800B+ annual DoD budget
- 12 ILS elements = 12 addressable verticals
- No competitor combines hash-only + public ledger + defense focus

---

## Roadmap
- Phase 1 ✅: SDK, token, website
- Phase 2 🔄: Defense platform, compliance, partnerships
- Phase 3: MVP pilot on real contract data
- Phase 4: REST API, SaaS, DIU/NavalX
- Phase 5: NIST, FedRAMP, production

---

## Tokenomics
- 100M $SLS: 30% public, 30% treasury (multi-sig), 20% dev, 20% ecosystem
- Utility token — not a security

---

## Team
- Built by ILS professionals
- Years of hands-on Navy and DoD program experience
- Charleston, SC

---

## Ask
- Strategic investment + partnerships
- SBIR/STTR, pilot programs, compliance certification
