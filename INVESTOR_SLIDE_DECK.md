# S4 Ledger: Investor Slide Deck

---

## Vision
S4 Ledger: Immutable logistics verification for the defense industry, anchored on XRPL, powered by $SLS.

---

## Problem
- Counterfeit parts, falsified maintenance records, unverifiable supply chains
- No common integrity layer across DoW logistics systems
- Siloed data, audit failures, delivery disputes

---

## Solution
- Anchor only SHA-256 hashes (never sensitive data) to XRPL
- Zero data on-chain — NIST/CMMC compliant
- 3-5s confirmation, ~$0.001 per anchor

---

## How It Works (Plain English)
- **The tools are the interface. The audit trail is the product.**
- S4 Ledger = a notary for defense records (SHA-256 hash → XRPL stamp)
- 11 tools calculate readiness, track obsolescence, monitor warranties, estimate costs
- Every tool generates real-time alerts: warranty expirations, DMSMS flags, readiness violations
- Unified Action Items tracker consolidates tasks across all tools
- One interface replaces juggling spreadsheets across 5 siloed systems

---

## Traction
- **$SLS token LIVE on XRPL Mainnet** — tradable, AMM pools, trustlines
- 100M total supply | ~15M circulating | 30M multi-sig treasury
- **12 interactive defense tools** live at s4ledger.com (not mockups)
- **462 real platforms** across 9 military branches
- **100+ real defense documents** in searchable reference library
- **Audit Record Vault** — automatic audit trail for every anchored record
- **Compliance Scorecard** — CMMC/NIST/DFARS compliance calculator
- Working Python SDK + CLI
- 14+ page website at s4ledger.com

## Cost Savings
| Tier | Government Savings/yr | S4 Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| Minimal (1–3 programs) | $180K–$420K | $48K–$120K ARR |
| Mid-Scale (5–15 programs) | $1.2M–$4.8M | $240K–$600K ARR |
| Enterprise (50+ programs) | $12M–$48M | $1.2M–$3.6M ARR |

Key: 65% labor reduction • 90% error savings • 70% audit reduction • 15-25% DMSMS avoidance

---

## Market
- $800B+ annual DoW budget
- 12 ILS elements = 12 addressable verticals
- No competitor combines hash-only + public ledger + defense focus

---

## Roadmap
- Phase 1 ✅: SDK, token, website
- Phase 2 ✅: 462 platforms, 11 tools, alerts, action tracking
- Phase 3: MVP pilot on real contract data
- Phase 4: REST API, SaaS, DIU/NavalX
- Phase 5: NIST, FedRAMP, production

---

## Tokenomics
- 100M $SLS: 30% public, 30% treasury (multi-sig), 20% dev, 20% ecosystem
- Utility token — not a security

---

## Team
- Built by ILS professionals
- Years of hands-on Navy and DoW program experience
- Charleston, SC

---

## Ask
