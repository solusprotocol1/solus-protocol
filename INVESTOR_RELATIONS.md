## Why the XRP Ledger?

S4 Ledger uses the XRP Ledger over Ethereum, Solana, and private blockchains for four defense-critical reasons:

| Requirement | XRPL | Ethereum | Private Chains |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Speed** | 3-5 seconds | 12+ minutes | Varies |
| **Cost** | ~$0.001/tx | $5–$50+/tx | $500K+ infrastructure |
| **Uptime** | 99.99% since 2012 | 99.9% | Operator-dependent |
| **Independence** | 150+ validators, public | Public but expensive | Vendor-controlled ❌ |

Private blockchains (Hyperledger, Guardtime KSI) defeat the purpose of independent verification. Ethereum's gas fees make volume anchoring cost-prohibitive. XRPL provides the speed, cost, neutrality, and reliability that defense logistics demands.

## Token Distribution

Total Supply: **100,000,000 $SLS**

| Allocation | Amount | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Public circulation | 30,000,000 SLS | Released |
| Operating treasury (multi-sig) | 30,000,000 SLS | Locked |
| Development reserve | 20,000,000 SLS | Reserved |
| Ecosystem incentives | 20,000,000 SLS | Reserved |
