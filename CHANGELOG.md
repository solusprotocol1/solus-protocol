The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.5.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **ILS Intelligence Hub** — Unified command center consolidating all 8 ILS tools (Gap Analysis, Action Items, Calendar, DMSMS, Readiness, Parts, ROI, Lifecycle, Warranty) into a single tabbed interface with sub-navigation and cross-tool data syncing
- **Calendar System** — Full month-grid calendar with day cells, event markers, navigation, add-event form, and upcoming-events sidebar. Auto-populates from action item schedules and custom events. Persisted via localStorage
- **Action Items "How It Works"** — Expandable details section explaining the cross-tool task queue, severity system, and delegation workflow
- **Hub Panel Syncing** — Tools inside the ILS Hub mirror data from standalone tabs (DMSMS stats, Readiness scores, Lifecycle costs, Warranty status)
- **Hub Action Items Breakdown** — Source-by-source breakdown showing open items per tool (DMSMS, Readiness, Warranty, etc.)
- **SDK Playground Expansion** — 6 new interactive examples: DMSMS Check, Readiness Calculator, ROI Analysis, Lifecycle Cost, Warranty Tracker, Action Items. Updated SDK Reference table (13 methods) and API Endpoints table (12 endpoints)
- **API Endpoints** — New `/api/action-items` and `/api/calendar` endpoints with query parameter filtering
- **OpenAPI Spec** — Added documentation for `/api/roi`, `/api/lifecycle`, `/api/warranty`, `/api/action-items`, `/api/calendar` endpoints
- **Python SDK Methods** — `get_action_items(severity, source)` and `get_calendar_events(month, year)` added to `S4SDK`
- **CLI Commands** — `s4-anchor action-items` and `s4-anchor calendar` commands added
- **Search Index** — 13 new entries for ILS Hub, Action Items, Calendar, DMSMS, Readiness, Parts, ROI, Lifecycle, Warranty, SDK Playground, Metrics, and Transactions
- **Cross-Page Hub Links** — Metrics and Transactions pages now include ILS Hub cross-link cards
- **Landing Page Hub Card** — ILS Intelligence explore card restyled as featured "ILS Intelligence Hub" with gradient border and Action Items card added

### Changed
- Landing page ILS Intelligence card → "ILS Intelligence Hub" with highlighted border and expanded description
- API version bumped to 3.5.0 (11 tools, 22 endpoints)
- OpenAPI spec fully documenting all ILS tool endpoints (was missing ROI and Warranty)

### Fixed
- **Lifecycle Cost formatting** — Values in $M now properly scale through K→M→B→T tiers via new `formatCostM()` function. Previously showed "$8024.0B" for values that should display as "$8.0B"
- `generateLifecycleActions()` now formats costs correctly using `formatCostM()` instead of hardcoded "$XB"

## [3.4.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Toast Notification System** — Real-time alert toasts for warranty expirations (90-day), DMSMS obsolescence detections, readiness threshold violations, and low-stock parts. Animated slide-in/out with severity levels (info/warning/danger/success), action buttons, auto-dismiss with progress bars.
- **Unified Action Items & Alerts Tab** — New consolidated tab replacing the standalone "How It Works" tab. Tracks actionable tasks from all 6 tools with severity-based sorting, filtering, localStorage persistence, and CSV export.
- **Tool Action Item Generators** — Every tool now generates specific actionable recommendations:
  - DMSMS: Bridge buy/alternate source actions for obsolete parts
  - Readiness: MTTR reduction plans for below-threshold systems
  - Warranty: Renewal/re-compete actions for expiring contracts (90-day alerts)
  - Parts: Reorder alerts for low-stock items, long lead-time warnings
  - Lifecycle: DMSMS savings opportunities, high sustainment ratio alerts
  - ROI: Business case documentation actions
- **Notification Bell** — Navbar bell icon with badge counter showing open action items
- **ILS Intelligence "How It Works"** — Collapsible details box with platform overview, 9-branch coverage, $SLS Mainnet token status
- **Landing page tools** — ROI Calculator, Lifecycle Cost Estimator, and Warranty & Contract Tracker added to Explore section (15 total cards)

### Changed
- **$SLS Token: LIVE on XRPL Mainnet** — Total Supply: 100,000,000 | Circulating: ~15,000,000 | AMM pools active | Trustlines established | Tradable on XRPL DEX
- Removed standalone "How It Works" tab (#tabAbout) — content merged into ILS Intelligence
- Updated PRODUCTION_READINESS.md: readiness score 67% -> 78%, XRPL integration 60% -> 85%
- Updated all documentation to reflect $SLS Mainnet status (not just Testnet)
- Action Items tab replaces How It Works in navigation (10 functional tabs)

### Fixed
- Differentiated total supply (100M $SLS) from circulating supply (~15M $SLS) across all docs

## [3.3.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **462 real defense platforms** across all 8 U.S. military branches (Navy, Army, Air Force, Space Force, Coast Guard, Marines, SOCOM, Joint)
- Master platform database (`s4-assets/platforms.js`) with category templates, component data, and deterministic NSN generation
- **ROI Calculator** — calculates annual savings, ROI %, payback period, and 5-year net benefit from S4 Ledger implementation
- **Lifecycle Cost Estimator** — projects total ownership cost (TOC) per DoD 5000.73 / MIL-STD-881F (acquisition, O&S, DMSMS, tech refresh)
- **Warranty & Contract Tracker** — tracks OEM warranties, CLIN deliverables, and contract expirations per FAR 46.7 / DFARS 246.7
- All existing tool dropdowns (ILS Intelligence, DMSMS, Readiness, Parts X-Ref) now dynamically populated from the 462-platform database
- 3 new API endpoints: `/api/roi`, `/api/lifecycle`, `/api/warranty`
- 3 new SDK methods: `calculate_roi()`, `estimate_lifecycle_cost()`, `track_warranty()`
- 3 new CLI commands: `s4-anchor roi`, `s4-anchor lifecycle`, `s4-anchor warranty`
- Anchor animation auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

### Changed
- API version bumped to 3.3.0 (9 tools, 20 endpoints)
- PROG_COMPONENTS and READINESS_DEFAULTS now proxy to the platform database (backwards compatible)
- Tab navigation shortened (DMSMS, Readiness, Parts) to fit 11 total tabs
- SDK version bumped to 3.3.0 with expanded tool listing
