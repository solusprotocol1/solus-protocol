## [3.8.4] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Transactions Page localStorage Fallback** — When `/api/transactions` is unavailable, transactions page now builds the full table from localStorage-synced anchored records instead of showing an error. Shows helpful guidance when no records exist
- **Transactions Page Timeout Guard** — Added AbortController with 8-second fetch timeout (matching metrics page) to prevent indefinite loading state
- **Cross-Page Auto-Sync** — Both metrics and transactions pages now listen for `storage` events. When records are anchored in the Demo App, metrics and transactions pages update instantly without waiting for the 30-second poll interval
- **Transactions USSF Branch Color** — Added Space Force branch color definition (was missing from transactions page)
- **Billion-Dollar Roadmap** — New `BILLION_DOLLAR_ROADMAP.md` document with complete financial analysis: detailed savings math per tool, 10-year revenue waterfall projections, Phase 1–4 growth strategy, 15 new capabilities needed for billion-dollar scale, comparable defense tech valuations (Palantir, Anduril, Govini), and CEO-ready 5-minute pitch
- **Path to $1B in Executive Proposal** — Added scaling math and 10 new capabilities table with development timelines and revenue unlocks to the executive proposal

### Fixed
- **Transactions Page Not Loading** — Transactions page previously failed silently when the API was unavailable, showing permanent "Loading..." state. Now properly falls back to localStorage records and displays informative empty state when no records exist
- **About Page Title Formatting** — "Our Mission" was inside a card box with left accent border, but "Our Story", "What Makes Us Different", and "Technology Stack" used unstyled section titles. All four now use consistent card-style formatting with bordered accent strips
- **How It Works Box Positioning** — Moved Anchor and Verify "How It Works" expandable sections from the sidebar column (col-lg-5) to directly under the tool's main content area (col-lg-7), matching the positioning pattern used by all 11 ILS Workspace tools

### Changed
- **Metrics Cross-Page Sync** — Added `storage` event listener to immediately refresh when new records are anchored from other pages
- **Transactions Filter Population** — Refactored filter population into dedicated `populateFilters()` function for cleaner code reuse between API and localStorage fallback paths

## [3.8.3] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Audit Vault Expanded Time Filters** — Added Last Week, Last Month, This Year, and Last Year filter options to the Audit Record Vault. Each filter calculates proper date ranges (e.g., Last Month = first day of previous month to first day of current month)
- **Audit Vault Time Savings** — New paragraph in Vault How It Works explaining how S4 Ledger reduces audit preparation labor by 85–95% (2–6 weeks → minutes)
- **Anchor Tool How It Works** — New expandable `<details>` section in Anchor panel with What's real, What's demo, How S4 saves money (99.9% cost reduction), and Production mode integration details
- **Verify Tool How It Works** — New expandable `<details>` section in Verify panel with What's real (cryptographic proof), How S4 saves money (90–98% verification labor reduction), and Production mode (automated batch verification via API)
- **SDK Playground How It Works Expanded** — Added expandable technical details section to SDK Playground with What's real, What's demo, How S4 saves money (95% integration cost reduction), and Production mode (pip install, API key, CI/CD integration)
- **SDK Playground Record Type Fallback** — 156+ hardcoded defense record types across 9 branches load automatically when the API is unavailable. Organized by branch with realistic record types, icons, and optgroups. SDK Playground now always has a populated dropdown
- **Economic Impact & Job Creation Section** — New section on landing page with data-driven economic impact metrics ($2.1B+ DoD manual ILS spend, 85–95% audit reduction, 340+ estimated jobs at scale, 3.4× DoD multiplier, $8M–$17M total impact). Includes job breakdown per 100 programs and small business enablement callout
- **Economic Impact in Executive Proposal** — Added full Economic Impact & Job Creation section with table and small business enablement narrative
- **Economic Impact in Internal Pitch** — Added economic growth math summary with Year 5 projections
- **Login Page Persistent Auth** — Auth state now uses `localStorage` instead of `sessionStorage` for 24-hour persistence across pages. All pages show logged-in user name in navbar via shared `main.js` auth-state awareness
- **Login Dashboard Cards Updated** — Added Audit Record Vault (LIVE) and Provisioning Tool (LIVE) cards, updated all card descriptions with latest capabilities (13-tool workspace, AI agent, 40+ provisioning items, per-item anchoring). Removed Audit Trail "COMING SOON" card (it's the Vault, now LIVE)

### Changed
- **"160+ record types" → "Any defense record type"** — Updated 20 instances across 11 files. New messaging: "Supports any defense record type — 156+ pre-built templates across 9 branches." Accurate count (156 actual types in API), and emphasizes that any custom record type can also be anchored
- **Login Page Navbar** — Now matches landing page navigation (Company dropdown, Products dropdown, Use Cases, Pricing, Roadmap, FAQ, Contact) instead of the previous simplified 5-link navbar
- **Metrics Page Loading Fix** — Added 8-second fetch timeout with AbortController, `finally` block guarantees "Loading..." text is always cleared even if chart rendering throws, and initializes metricsData on catch path
- **Metrics ILS Reference** — Updated from "12-tool" to "13-tool" with provisioning added to tool list
- **Tool Count Audit** — Updated all references from "12 tools" → "13 tools" and "11 tools" → "13 tools" across index.html, WHITEPAPER.md, INVESTOR_PITCH.md, INVESTOR_SLIDE_DECK.md, BAA_TEMPLATE.md, PRODUCTION_READINESS.md, and s4-use-cases/index.html
- **Branch Count Audit** — Fixed "6 military branches" → "9" in Executive Proposal, "8 branches" → "9" in PRODUCTION_READINESS.md
- **BAA Template** — Updated to v3.8.3, added Provisioning Tool as 13th integrated tool

- **Parts Inventory Table** — Interactive parts table with search bar, status filter dropdown, per-item "Anchor" buttons, value totals, and hover effects
- **Per-Item & Batch Anchoring** — Individual anchor buttons per part row with animation + "Anchor All to XRPL" batch button that processes all items with progress feedback. Both call `/api/anchor`, `saveLocalRecord()`, and update metrics automatically
- **SDK Playground Function Boxes** — Replaced 12 small buttons with 16 card-style function boxes in a responsive grid. Each box shows icon, title, description, and SDK method name. Clicking any box loads code and immediately executes it
- **SDK Playground New Functions** — Added List Records, Record Types, and Provisioning runners with full output formatting. Added corresponding Python code templates
- **Always-Visible Record Type Selector** — Record type dropdown (156+ types, 9 branches) now appears at the top of the SDK Playground instead of being hidden for some functions

### Changed

- **SDK Playground layout** — Function boxes replace button row; record type selector always visible; reference tables updated with provisioning endpoints; How It Works text updated

## [3.8.1] - 2026-02-16

### Changed
- **Floating AI Agent** — AI Agent extracted from Gap Analysis panel and converted to a floating widget accessible from all 13 ILS Workspace tools. Appears as a chat bubble in the bottom-right corner. Context-aware quick-action buttons update automatically when switching tools (e.g., switching to DMSMS shows "Obsolete Parts", "Alt Sources"; switching to Provisioning shows "ICAPS Comparison", "Explain PTD"). Includes tool context label showing which tool is active. Agent only appears on the ILS Workspace tab.
- **Back-to-top button** — Moved from bottom-right to bottom-left to avoid overlap with floating AI agent

## [3.8.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Provisioning & PTD Manager** — New ILS Workspace panel (`hub-provisioning`) that replaces ICAPS (DAU's Interactive Computer-Aided Provisioning System). Manages Provisioning Technical Documentation (PTD) per MIL-STD-1552, generates Allowance Parts Lists (APLs), tracks NSN cataloging status via Federal Cataloging System (FCS), and monitors Provisioning Performance Schedules. Blockchain-anchored provisioning decisions. All-branch support (ICAPS is Navy/USMC only). Includes ICAPS comparison banner showing 6 competitive advantages.
- **AI Agent — New Tool Coverage** — Added topic matchers for Audit Vault, Compliance Scorecard, Defense Document Library, Provisioning/PTD, and ICAPS comparison. 4 new quick-action buttons (Audit Vault, Compliance, Doc Library, ICAPS Comparison). Agent can now answer questions about all 13 workspace tools.
- **SDK Provisioning Command** — New `s4-anchor provisioning` CLI command and `get_provisioning_status()` SDK method returning PTD progress, APL count, NSN cataloging, and ICAPS competitive advantages.

### Changed
- **ILS Workspace expanded to 13 panels** — added Provisioning & PTD Manager alongside existing 12 tools
- **How It Works boxes standardized** — Vault, Doc Library, and Compliance Scorecard panels now use the same colored-background pattern (What's real / What's demo / How S4 saves money / Production mode) as all other tools
- **Landing page renamed** — "ILS Workspace Analyzer" → "ILS Workspace", "Launch ILS Analyzer" → "Launch ILS Workspace", explore card updated with all 13 tools
- **Metrics page fallback** — When `/api/metrics` is unavailable, the page now generates metrics from localStorage records with full time-series bucketing (minute/hour/day/week/month) instead of showing empty charts
- **API version** → 3.8.0 with provisioning-ptd in tools list
- **OpenAPI spec** → 3.8.0 with updated description listing all 13 tools

### Fixed
- **How It Works visual inconsistency** — New panels (vault, docs, compliance) used plain `<details>` with no background color and different icon (`fa-circle-info` vs `fa-info-circle`). Now matches existing tool pattern with colored backgrounds, structured content sections, and consistent typography.
- **Metrics page blank on API failure** — Catch block only logged error. Now builds complete metrics dataset from localStorage with record type distribution, branch breakdown, and time-series data for all 5 chart views.
- **Landing page CTA mismatch** — Hero still said "ILS Workspace Analyzer" and button said "Launch ILS Analyzer" despite v3.6.0 rename.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-02-16
