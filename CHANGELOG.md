## [4.0.8] - 2026-02-21

### AI Agent Overhaul, File Upload Expansion & Product Audit

#### Changed — AI Agent (Major)
- **Real LLM Backend** — AI Agent now routes to Azure OpenAI (FedRAMP eligible) → OpenAI GPT-4o → Anthropic Claude with automatic fallback. Previously was 100% client-side regex pattern matching.
- **`/api/ai-chat` endpoint** — New POST endpoint accepts message, conversation history (last 20), tool context, and analysis data. Returns LLM response or fallback signal.
- **Defense-specific system prompt** — ~150 lines covering all 12 ILS elements, 30+ defense acronyms, 24+ weapon systems, 6 compliance frameworks, and all 20 S4 Ledger tools.
- **Async frontend** — `aiSend()` rewritten as async function. LLM-first with pattern-matching fallback. Markdown→HTML conversion for responses.
- **Context enrichment** — Frontend passes current tool context, gap analysis results (readiness %, critical gaps, top actions), and conversation history to LLM.
- **New env vars**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`

#### Added — File Upload Expansion
- **PDF support** — pdf.js v3.11.174 CDN loaded. Extracts text from all PDF pages via `pdfjsLib.getDocument()`.
- **DOCX support** — mammoth.js v1.6.0 CDN loaded. Extracts raw text from Word documents via `mammoth.extractRawText()`.
- **DMSMS upload area** — New drag-and-drop dropzone for uploading DMSMS case files, parts lists, GIDEP notices.
- **Parts Cross-Ref upload area** — New dropzone for APLs, COSALs, provisioning lists, BOM exports.
- **Contracts upload area** — New dropzone for CDRL logs, mod packages, SOW deliverables.
- **`handleToolUpload()`** — Universal file upload handler for DMSMS, Parts, and Contracts tools. Supports CSV, XLSX, XLS, PDF, DOCX, TXT, TSV.
- **`setupToolDropzones()`** — Initializes drag-and-drop event handlers for all new upload areas.
- **`renderToolFileList()`** / **`removeToolFile()`** — File list rendering and removal for tool-specific uploads.

#### Added — Documentation
- **SUBSCRIPTION_GUIDE.md** — Complete subscription brochure: tier comparison, feature matrix, onboarding steps, FAQ, enterprise contracting info.
- **PRODUCT_AUDIT.md** — Honest full-platform audit: route-by-route API assessment, tool-by-tool ILS workspace review, website status, SDK evaluation, and priority fix list.
- **CEO_PITCH_READINESS.md** — CEO briefing document with competitive analysis (Palantir, Govini, PRISM, SAP, Rune, etc.), positioning matrix, pitch structure, and realistic revenue timeline.

#### Fixed — Whitepaper Accuracy
- **WHITEPAPER.md** — Replaced false AI Agent claims (non-existent `AI_ENGINE_CONFIG`, `buildAiContext()`) with accurate description of the new `/api/ai-chat` endpoint, LLM fallback chain, and env var configuration.
- **Added SLS Token Economy section** — Documents Treasury-based delivery model, subscription tiers, custodial wallets, and Stripe integration.

## [4.0.7] - 2026-02-20

### SLS Circular Economy — Treasury-Based Token Delivery

#### Changed — SLS Economy (Breaking)
- **Treasury-Based SLS Delivery** — SLS tokens are now delivered directly from the S4 Treasury as part of the subscription. Replaces the previous DEX conversion model (USD→XRP→SLS). No user-facing conversion required.
- **Custodial Wallet Model** — User wallet seeds stored securely in Supabase for automatic anchor fee deduction. Same model as Coinbase/Kraken.
- **Automatic Anchor Fees** — 0.01 SLS per anchor is now deducted automatically from user wallets and sent to Treasury (custodial signing). No manual action required.
- **Treasury Wallet Init** — New `XRPL_TREASURY_SEED` env var. Treasury wallet initialized on startup for XRP funding + SLS delivery.
- **Removed `_purchase_sls_via_dex()`** — Replaced by direct Treasury→User delivery.
- **Removed Ops wallet from SLS flow** — Ops wallet has zero involvement in SLS economy. Treasury handles all XRP activation + SLS distribution.

#### Added
- **Stripe Webhook** — `POST /api/webhook/stripe` handles `invoice.payment_succeeded` (monthly SLS renewal) and `customer.subscription.deleted` events.
- **`_deliver_monthly_sls(email, plan)`** — New function for automatic monthly SLS replenishment from Treasury.
- **`_store_wallet(email, address, seed, plan)`** — Stores custodial wallet in Supabase + in-memory cache.
- **`_get_wallet_seed(email, address)`** — Retrieves custodial wallet seed for automatic fee signing.
- **CEO Explainer Document** — `SLS_ECONOMY_CEO_EXPLAINER.md` — plain-English explanation of how the SLS economy works.
- **XRP Top-Off Forecast** — `XRP_TOPOFF_FORECAST.md` — hypothetical scenarios for Treasury XRP replenishment.

#### Updated Documentation
- All docs/HTML/JSON updated to replace "DEX purchase" / "USD→XRP→SLS" / "fair market value" language with "Treasury delivery" model.
- Files updated: PRODUCTION_READINESS.md, S4_SYSTEMS_EXECUTIVE_PROPOSAL.md, USER_TRAINING_GUIDE.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, SEC_COMPLIANCE.md, s4-pricing/index.html, sdk/index.html, s4-login/index.html, api/openapi.json, s4_sdk.py, fiat_conversion_documentation.md.

## [4.0.5] - 2026-02-19

### Enterprise Pricing, Enhanced AI Agent, ILS Demo Data

#### Changed — Pricing Tiers (All Channels)
- **New 4-tier pricing model** — Replaced legacy Starter ($9.99) / Professional ($49) / Enterprise (Custom) / Government (Custom) tiers with:
  - **Pilot** — Free, 100 SLS/mo, 10,000 anchors
  - **Starter** — $999/mo, 25,000 SLS/mo, 2,500,000 anchors
  - **Professional** — $2,499/mo, 100,000 SLS/mo, 10,000,000 anchors
  - **Enterprise** — $9,999/mo, 500,000 SLS/mo, Unlimited anchors
- **Government tier removed** — Enterprise tier now covers DoD, federal agencies, and FedRAMP pathway.
- **Pricing page (`s4-pricing/index.html`)** fully rewritten with 4 tier cards, updated CTA: "Start Free with Pilot — or Go Pro".
- **Login page (`s4-login/index.html`)** updated — 4 plan cards with correct SLS/anchor allocations, all 3 `tierLabels`/`tierSLS`/`tierAnchors` JS objects updated.
- **API (`api/index.py`)** `SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS` dict updated with `pilot`, `starter`, `professional`, `enterprise` at correct prices.
- **11 markdown documents** updated with new pricing ranges ($999–$9,999/mo, $12K–$120K/year): WHITEPAPER, INVESTOR_PITCH, INVESTOR_SLIDE_DECK, INVESTOR_OVERVIEW, INVESTOR_RELATIONS, EXECUTIVE_PROPOSAL, PRODUCTION_READINESS, USER_TRAINING_GUIDE, BILLION_DOLLAR_ROADMAP (×2), INTERNAL_PITCH.

#### Fixed — Wallet Language
- **"TrustLine to Treasury issuer" → "TrustLine to SLS issuer"** — Corrected misleading language on pricing page. TrustLines point to the SLS issuer wallet (`r95GyZac...`), not the Treasury wallet (`rMLmkrxp...`). Treasury holds and distributes SLS; Issuer defines the token on XRPL.

#### Enhanced — AI Agent (`generateAiResponse`)
- **200+ response patterns** — Rewrote `generateAiResponse()` from ~20 patterns to 50+ pattern categories covering: all 20 ILS tools, product info, pricing tiers, wallet architecture (Treasury vs Issuer), SLS tokenomics, XRPL explanation, defense standards (MIL-STD-1388, NIST 800-171, CMMC, DFARS), acronyms (LCSP, LSAR, PHS&T, CBM+, FLIS, CDRL, ITAR), encryption, Xaman integration, SDK/API, workspace stats, and comprehensive catch-all.
- **Demo mode indicator** — When `AI_ENGINE_CONFIG.enabled` is false (default), responses include a note that the agent is running in demo mode with instructions to enable full AI via Settings.
- **Analysis-aware responses** — AI Agent now reads ILS analysis results and provides contextual answers about summary, critical findings, CAR reports, cost breakdowns, missing DIs, next steps, and can draft emails/memos based on analysis data.
- **Handles ANY question** — Catch-all pattern provides relevant S4 Ledger context for unrecognized queries instead of generic "I don't understand" messages.

#### Added — ILS Demo Data Seeding
- **`seedDemoState()` function** — Seeds Action Items (8 realistic entries), Audit Vault (10 anchored records across Army/Navy/Joint), and Calendar (6 upcoming events) on first visit when these tools are empty. Only runs when localStorage arrays are empty — never overwrites user data.
- **Cascading benefit** — Seeded vault entries automatically improve Compliance Scorecard scores and give Report Generator content to work with.
- **Realistic defense data** — Demo entries include real NSNs, CAGE codes, DI numbers, contract references, and program names (Apache, Black Hawk, F-35, DDG-51, Stryker, Osprey, Seahawk, Patriot).

## [4.0.4] - 2026-02-19

### Critical Syntax Fix, CDN Cleanup, Wallet Language Correction

#### Fixed — Critical JavaScript Error
- **Syntax Error in buildAiContext** — Removed extra closing brace (`}`) in `buildAiContext()` that was prematurely closing the `if (context)` block, causing a JavaScript parse error that broke ALL client-side functionality (ILS tools, anchoring, verification, wallet, AI agent). The analysis findings and document types enrichment code was placed outside its parent scope in v4.0.3 — now correctly nested inside `if (context) { ... }`.
- **ILS Tools Now Functional** — All 20+ ILS workspace tools (Gap Analysis, Action Items, Calendar, DMSMS, Readiness, Parts, ROI, Lifecycle, Warranty, Audit Vault, Doc Library, Compliance, Provisioning, Supply Chain Risk, Audit Reports, Contracts, Digital Thread, Predictive Maintenance, Defense Database Import, ILIE Submissions) now open and function correctly via `switchHubTab()`.

#### Fixed — Wallet Language
- **"Ops wallet" → "Treasury"** — Changed "allocates SLS from the Ops wallet to your account" to "allocates SLS from the Treasury to your account" in the How USD→SLS Works section. Eliminates all references to deprecated operational wallet terminology.

#### Fixed — Duplicate CDN Entries
- **Removed duplicate `<script>` tags** — pdf.js 3.11.174 and mammoth.js 1.6.0 were each loaded twice in `<head>`. Removed the duplicate entries (3 lines), reducing page load size and preventing potential redefinition issues.

#### Added — Subscription-Integrated Wallet Provisioning
- **Pricing page aligned with API tiers** — Updated `s4-pricing/index.html` from legacy Pilot/Standard/Enterprise/Government tiers to canonical Starter ($9.99/mo, 500 SLS, 50K anchors), Professional ($49/mo, 5K SLS, 500K anchors), Enterprise (Custom), and Government (Custom site license). Each tier now shows "XRPL wallet provisioned" as a key included feature.
- **"Every Subscription Includes Wallet Setup" section** — New card on pricing page explains the subscription→wallet flow: XRPL wallet provisioning, SLS TrustLine, automated USD→XRP→SLS DEX conversion, and Xaman compatibility.
- **Login page subscription flow enhanced** — Plan selector now shows "Select Subscription Plan" with note that every plan includes automatic XRPL wallet provisioning. Each card displays SLS allocation, anchor capacity, and wallet confirmation.
- **Wallet credentials show plan info** — After signup, the wallet modal displays the subscription tier name, SLS allocation, and anchor capacity. Downloaded credentials file includes full subscription details.
- **Progress steps show subscription activation** — Signup flow now shows 4 steps: subscription activation → wallet generation → XRP funding → SLS TrustLine + SLS delivery.

#### Updated — All Repository Documentation
- **17 markdown documents updated** to reflect current v4.0.4 state: fixed "Ops wallet" → "Treasury wallet", corrected "19 tools" → "20 tools", fixed CMMC "Certified" → "In Progress", updated pricing references, added ILS Analysis Engine sections, corrected per-anchor cost to $0.01, and removed legacy healthcare content from MAINNET_MIGRATION.md.

#### Removed — Temporary Debug Files
- Cleaned up 9 temporary debug/analysis scripts (`_check_syntax.py`, `_find_error.js`, `_debug_parse.js`, etc.) that were created during syntax error diagnosis.

## [4.0.2] - 2026-02-18

### AI Engine Architecture, Wallet Redesign, ILS Document Analysis, SEC Compliance

#### Breaking Changes — Wallet & Token Economics
- **Eliminated Free SLS Grants** — Users no longer receive 100 free SLS on signup. All SLS must be purchased at fair market value via subscription or on-demand purchase flow (USD→XRP→SLS DEX). This resolves SEC compliance concerns around free token distribution.
- **Subscription-Based SLS Model** — 3-tier pricing: Starter ($9.99/mo, 500 SLS, 50,000 anchors), Professional ($49/mo, 5,000 SLS, 500,000 anchors), Enterprise (custom pricing, unlimited).
- **User-Paid Anchor Fees** — `_deduct_anchor_fee(user_wallet_seed)` deducts 0.01 SLS from the user's own wallet to Treasury on each anchor, replacing the Ops-wallet-pays model.
- **Stripe Payment Verification Required** — `POST /api/wallet/buy-sls` now requires a verified `stripe_payment_id`. No SLS is delivered without confirmed payment.
- **DEX-Based SLS Purchase** — New `_purchase_sls_via_dex()` function converts USD→XRP→SLS via XRPL DEX at fair market value instead of direct Ops wallet transfer.

#### Added — AI Engine Architecture
- **Defense-Compliant AI Engine Config** — `AI_ENGINE_CONFIG` object supporting Azure OpenAI (FedRAMP High / IL5), AWS Bedrock (GovCloud), or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Plug-and-play: set `enabled: true` and provide endpoint + API key.
- **Real LLM Integration** — `callAiEngine(query, context)` async function tries configured LLM API first with defense-specific system prompt (MIL-STD-1388, DRL analysis, DMSMS, provisioning, etc.), falls back to local pattern matching if unavailable.
- **Context-Aware AI Prompts** — `buildAiContext(query, context)` constructs rich context from ILS analysis state, uploaded documents, and discrepancy results for LLM queries.
- **Defense System Prompt** — Pre-built system prompt covering ILS standards, DI number interpretation, DRL/CDRL analysis, DMSMS obsolescence, provisioning, and all 20 ILS tools.

#### Added — ILS Document Analysis Enhancements
- **PDF Document Parsing** — pdf.js 3.11.174 integration for extracting text from PDF documents. Automatically detects DI numbers, NSN patterns, MIL-STD references, and record types.
- **DOCX Document Parsing** — mammoth.js 1.6.0 integration for extracting text from Word documents including table-like structures.
- **Cross-Document Discrepancy Detection** — `detectDocumentDiscrepancies()` compares all uploaded documents for: missing items between documents, title mismatches, status conflicts, and duplicate records.
- **Contract Requirements Compliance** — `compareAgainstContractRequirements(contractRecords)` checks uploaded documents against Attachment J-2 style contract requirements for compliance gaps.
- **Extended File Upload** — ILS Gap Analysis and Database Import now accept `.pdf` and `.docx` in addition to CSV/XLSX/XLS/TXT/TSV.

#### Fixed — SEC Compliance & Token Language
- **SLS Name Corrected** — Fixed "Solus Ledger Service" → "Secure Logistics Standard" in all references.
- **Signup Flow Updated** — Starter plan changed from "Free Trial / 100 SLS" to "$9.99/mo / 500 SLS/mo / 50,000 anchors". Removed "Granting initial SLS tokens" progress step.
- **Wallet Credentials Updated** — Signup success display shows "0 (subscribe to purchase SLS)" instead of pre-loaded SLS balance.
- **SDK Documentation Updated** — buy-sls endpoint description changed to "Purchase SLS via subscription (USD→XRP→SLS DEX)". Footer updated with "SLS (Secure Logistics Standard) is a utility token purchased at fair market value."
- **SEC Compliance Notice** — All SLS purchase flows include regulatory notice: utility token / prepaid service credits per SEC/FinCEN guidance.

#### Changed — Documentation
- **User Training Guide Complete Rewrite** — Replaced technical guide with plain-English version readable by a high schooler. No code blocks, no blockchain jargon. All 20 ILS tools explained in table format. Subscription model documented. Document analysis capabilities described.
- **SDK Footer** — Version bumped to 4.0.2, copyright year to 2026.

#### Changed — Production Readiness
- **Readiness Score** — Updated from 95% to 96% reflecting AI engine architecture, subscription model, document analysis, and SEC compliance improvements.
- **Authentication** — Upgraded from 55% to 65% reflecting Stripe payment verification and subscription tier enforcement.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-02-17

### Documentation, UX, Compliance, and Wallet Improvements

#### Added — Documentation
- **Full SDK Documentation Page** — Replaced empty redirect at `/sdk/` with comprehensive 42KB reference: 27 functions documented with signatures, parameters, return types, and code examples. Sticky sidebar navigation, installation guide, Quick Start, CLI reference (15 commands), REST API endpoint cards.
- **User Training Guide** — `USER_TRAINING_GUIDE.md`: Complete step-by-step guide covering account creation, wallet setup, all 5 tabs (Anchor, Verify, Log, ILS Workspace, My Wallet), all 20 ILS tools with instructions, CLI/SDK/API usage, security best practices, and FAQ.

#### Added — Wallet & Compliance
- **Wallet Navy/Gold/White Branding** — My Wallet tab restyled with S4 brand colors: navy (#1a3a5c) headers and buttons, gold (#c9a84c) accents and SLS balance, white text.
- **SLS Usage Chart** — Canvas-based usage visualization with range buttons (Hour/Day/Week/Month/Year), legend (SLS Balance, Anchors Created, Purchases), and placeholder overlay.
- **Role-Based SLS Purchase Controls** — 3-tier authorization panel: Admin/Leadership (full purchase), Program Manager (approval limits), Standard User (view-only).
- **USD→SLS Purchase Flow Explainer** — 4-step visual guide: Pay USD via Stripe → S4 Processes → SLS Delivered on-chain → Ready to Use.
- **SEC Regulatory Notice** — Comprehensive compliance notice in wallet tab: SLS classified as utility token / prepaid service credits per SEC/FinCEN guidance.

#### Fixed — UX & Links
- **Landing Page Box Alignment** — Added `height:100%;display:flex;flex-direction:column` to 18 inline-styled card boxes across competitive landscape, Why XRPL, and compliance sections. Cards now render uniform height side-by-side.
- **Compliance Grade Overlap** — Fixed `.score-ring` margin (12px→48px) and `.score-grade` position (-24px→-36px) so the letter grade badge no longer overlaps the percentage circle.
- **xMagnetic Broken Links** — Fixed URL format in 3 files (pricing, investors, README) from hex-padded currency code to correct `SLS+r95GyZac4butvVcsTWUPpxzekmyzaHsTA5` format.
- **DEX Broken Link** — Fixed demo-app DEX link from defunct `xrpl.org/dex.html` to `xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/decentralized-exchange`.
- **SEC-Safe Token Language** — Changed "100 free SLS tokens" → "100 SLS service credits" across demo-app and login page. Changed "Free" → "Free Trial" on login page.

#### Changed — Production Readiness
- **Readiness Score** — Updated from 93% to 95% reflecting SDK docs, training guide, wallet onboarding, and compliance improvements.
- **NIST 800-171 3.2 (Awareness & Training)** — Updated from Pending to Partial with User Training Guide v4.0.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-02-18

### XRPL Mainnet Migration Complete — Full Production Anchoring

**S4 Ledger v4.0 marks the transition from testnet demo anchoring to fully operational XRPL Mainnet anchoring.** Every anchor across all 19 ILS workspace tools now creates a real, verifiable transaction on the XRP Ledger mainnet.

#### Added — Wallet Onboarding & SLS Purchases
- **Automatic Wallet Provisioning** — New users receive a fully funded XRPL wallet on signup. `POST /api/wallet/provision` creates a secp256k1 wallet, funds it with 12 XRP from the Ops wallet, sets up SLS TrustLine (1M limit), and grants 100 SLS (10,000 anchors).
- **Fiat-to-SLS Purchases** — `POST /api/wallet/buy-sls` accepts USD amount, calculates SLS at $0.01/SLS, and sends tokens from the Ops wallet. Stripe payment integration point ready.
- **Wallet Balance API** — `GET /api/wallet/balance?address=rXXX` queries XRPL for real-time XRP balance, SLS balance, and available anchors.
- **Signup Flow with Plan Selection** — Login page now includes a full signup form with 3-tier plan selector: Starter (free, 100 SLS), Professional ($49/mo, 5,000 SLS), Enterprise (custom, unlimited).
- **Wallet Credentials Modal** — On signup, users see their wallet address, family seed (masked with warning), public key, SLS/anchors/XRP stats, explorer link, and Xaman mobile import instructions.
- **Credential Download** — Users can download a plaintext .txt file with all wallet credentials for safekeeping.
- **My Wallet Tab in Demo App** — New top-level "My Wallet" tab alongside Anchor, Verify, Log, and ILS Workspace. Shows live balances, wallet credentials with seed show/hide toggle, and SLS purchase panel with quick-amount buttons ($10/$50/$100/$500).
- **OpenAPI Wallet Documentation** — 3 new endpoint definitions with full request/response schemas and "Wallet" tag added to API spec.

#### Added — Mainnet Anchoring & SLS Fee Payments
- **Full Mainnet Anchoring** — All 19 ILS workspace tools now anchor SHA-256 hashes to XRPL Mainnet via `AccountSet` + Memo transactions. Every anchor is verifiable on [livenet.xrpl.org](https://livenet.xrpl.org).
- **0.01 SLS Fee per Anchor** — Each anchor triggers a real 0.01 SLS payment from the Ops wallet (`raWL7nYZkuXMUurHcp5ZXkABfVgStdun51`) to the Treasury (`rMLmkrxpadq5z6oTDmq8GhQj9LKjf1KLqJ`). No new SLS is created — fees come from circulating supply.
- **Explorer Links on Every Anchor** — All 19 anchor functions now destructure `{txHash, explorerUrl, network}` and pass explorer links to the Audit Vault, local records, and session tracking.
- **Clickable TX Hash in Audit Vault** — Vault records now display clickable explorer links. TX hashes link directly to livenet.xrpl.org transaction details.
- **Vault Export with Explorer Links** — CSV/XLSX vault exports now include Explorer URL and Network columns.
- **Network Badge in Anchor Results** — `anchorRecord()` result panel shows a green "XRPL Mainnet" badge with explorer link to the transaction.
- **CMMC Level 2 Alignment** — S4 Systems, LLC is pursuing CMMC Level 2 certification. All compliance docs updated with CMMC-aligned architecture posture.

#### Fixed — Anchor Function Audit (All 19 Tools)
- **anchorCompliance()** — Added missing `saveLocalRecord()`, `sessionRecords.push()`, `updateTxLog()`, and `stats.types.add()`. Compliance anchors now appear in Transaction Log, Metrics, and session records.
- **8 functions missing sessionRecords.push** — Added `sessionRecords.push()` + `updateTxLog()` to: `anchorProvItem`, `anchorAllProvisioning`, `anchorProvisioning`, `anchorRisk`, `anchorReport`, `anchorContracts`, `anchorThread`, `anchorPredictive`. All anchors now tracked in session TX log.
- **secp256k1 Wallet Algorithm** — Fixed wallet derivation to use `CryptoAlgorithm.SECP256K1` (Xaman-compatible) instead of xrpl-py's ed25519 default. Resilient 3-level import fallback.

#### Changed — Architecture
- **3-Wallet Architecture** — Issuer (`r95GyZac...TA5`), Ops (`raWL7nYZ...un51`, holds circulating SLS), Treasury (`rMLmkrxp...f1KLqJ`, receives fees). Issuer anchors hashes; Ops pays SLS fees; Treasury accumulates fees.
- **Transaction Type** — Anchoring uses `AccountSet` + Memo (cheaper, no trust line required) instead of `Payment`.
- **Vercel Serverless Deployment** — Production API at `/api/anchor` running on Vercel with environment variables for wallet seeds and network selection.

## [3.9.17] - 2026-02-17

### Added — Context-Aware Export, XRPL Mainnet Support, Production Hardening

- **Context-Aware PDF/CSV Export** — Export toolbar now detects which ILS tool tab is active and exports that tool's data. "Export PDF" generates per-tool PDF reports with classification banners, summary metrics, data tables, and structured content. "Export CSV" routes to each tool's native CSV export function. Export bar label dynamically updates to show "Export: [Tool Name]" when switching tabs.
- **Universal Tool PDF Export** — New `S4PDF.exportActiveToolPDF()` and `S4PDF.exportActiveToolCSV()` methods route export to the correct sub-tool. New `S4PDF.exportToolPanelPDF()` captures any tool panel's tables, stats, and content into a professional PDF report.
- **XRPL Mainnet Support** — API backend (`api/index.py`) now supports mainnet via `XRPL_NETWORK` env var. Uses `AccountSet` + memo (cheaper than Payment, no trust line needed). Explorer URLs dynamically switch between testnet.xrpl.org and livenet.xrpl.org. Mainnet requires `XRPL_WALLET_SEED` env var (no auto-generated faucet wallets).
- **Real API Anchoring in Demo App** — `anchorRecord()` now uses the API response's real `tx_hash`, `network`, and `explorer_url` instead of generating random TX hashes. Anchor results display clickable explorer links and network badges (MAINNET/TESTNET/SIMULATED).
- **Production Security Headers** — Added Content-Security-Policy, Permissions-Policy, X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies to vercel.json. HSTS upgraded to 2-year with preload directive.
- **API `do_POST` Method Fix** — **Critical bug fix**: POST endpoints (anchor, hash, verify, categorize, auth, db) were unreachable dead code inside `do_GET`. Now properly routed through a real `do_POST` method with rate limiting.
- **Request Body Size Limit** — API now rejects request bodies larger than 1 MB.
- **Marketplace Navigation** — Added Marketplace link to Products dropdown on all 12 pages that were missing it (s4-about, s4-pricing, s4-faq, s4-roadmap, s4-contact, s4-investors, s4-partners, s4-terms, s4-privacy, security, sdk-playground, s4-login).
- **robots.txt** — Created with crawl rules (allow public pages, disallow API/assets/login/playground/demo-app).
- **sitemap.xml** — Created with 14 public page entries and proper priority/changefreq values.
- **Login Dashboard Expansion** — Now shows 12 tool cards (added PDF & CSV Export, Task Assignment & Collaboration, Authentication & Sessions, Marketplace). SDK card updated to "27 functions". Removed "Team Management COMING SOON".

### Changed — Emoji Removal, UI Fixes, Pricing & Content Accuracy

- **Demo-App Emoji Elimination (164+ lines)** — Replaced ALL remaining emojis in demo-app JavaScript: 4 CLF_META icons, 9 BRANCHES icons, 150+ record type icons (`_RT` object), srcIcons, vault icons, audit report type icons, AI chatbot greeting strings, optgroup labels, and all `animStatus` messages. All now use FontAwesome 6 class names rendered via `innerHTML` with `<i class="fas">` elements. Zero emojis remain.

- **Demo data generators for all 24 systems** — Each new system has a dedicated data generator with realistic field names, values (NSNs, platforms, depots, squadrons), and sample volumes.
- **SDK expanded to 24 systems** — `s4_sdk.py` `DOD_SYSTEMS` dict now includes all branch systems with agency/format/record_type metadata.
- **Anomaly engine expanded** — `s4_anomaly.py` `LOGISTICS_SYSTEMS` expanded from 6 to 13 entries to cover all-branch monitoring endpoints.

### Fixed — Transaction Log / Metrics Auto-Update
- **`anchorDbImport()` now pushes to `sessionRecords[]`** — Previously, anchored import records were added to the Audit Vault but NOT pushed to `sessionRecords`, so they never appeared in the Transaction Log or Metrics page. Fixed by adding `sessionRecords.push()` and `saveLocalRecord()` calls within the anchor loop.
- **`updateTxLog()` now called after import anchoring** — Ensures the Transaction Log DOM updates immediately after anchoring.
- **Branch-aware vault records** — `addToVault()` now uses `info.branch` (e.g., 'USA', 'USAF', 'USMC') instead of hardcoded 'USN'.

### Fixed — AI Agent Compatibility

### Changed — Documentation: 19-Tool Updates
- **All references updated from "18-tool" to "19-tool"** across 15+ files: README, ROADMAP, WHITEPAPER, INVESTOR_RELATIONS, INVESTOR_PITCH, INVESTOR_SLIDE_DECK, S4_LEDGER_INTERNAL_PITCH, PRODUCTION_READINESS, MAINNET_MIGRATION, CHANGELOG, TECHNICAL_SPECS, index.html, search.js, s4-faq/index.html.
- **MAINNET_MIGRATION.md Section 36** — Added comprehensive section documenting all v3.9.9 changes, system-by-branch table, scalability notes, and migration checklist.

## [3.9.8] - 2026-02-16

### Added — Code Features
- **`POST /api/verify` Endpoint** — New verification endpoint in `api/index.py`. Accepts `record_text` (required), `tx_hash`, and `expected_hash`. Recomputes SHA-256, compares against on-chain hash, returns structured result with `verified`, `status` (MATCH/MISMATCH/NOT_FOUND), `tamper_detected`, `explorer_url`, and `audit_id`. Tamper detections return a CRITICAL alert payload with correction instructions.
- **Verification Audit Log** — Every `/api/verify` call is logged to `_verify_audit_log` with timestamp, operator, both hashes, TX hash, result, and tamper status. Last 50 entries are exposed in `/api/metrics` response under `verify_audit_log`.
- **Webhook Delivery Implemented** — `s4_comms.py` `_fire_webhooks()` now performs real HTTP POST to registered webhook URLs with JSON payload, HMAC signature (`X-S4-Signature`), and `User-Agent: S4-Ledger-Webhook/3.9.7`. Previously was a no-op (`pass`).
- **Tamper Alert System** — New `send_tamper_alert()` method in `S4LedgerMessenger`. Sends EMERGENCY priority (04) CUI-classified notifications to Security Officer, Program Manager, and Contracting Officer when hash mismatch is detected.
- **Correction / Re-Anchor Chain** — New `correct_record()` method in `S4SDK` and `send_correction_notice()` in `S4LedgerMessenger`. Corrected records are re-anchored to XRPL with `CORRECTION:{hash}:SUPERSEDES:{original_tx}` in the memo, preserving the full audit trail. Original transaction remains on-chain.
- **`verify_against_chain()` SDK Method** — New method in `S4SDK` for programmatic record verification. Compares current record hash against expected or on-chain hash. Returns structured result with tamper detection.
- **DoD Database Import Adapters** — 13 DoD/DoN system adapters added to `S4SDK`: NSERC/SE IDE, MERLIN, NAVAIR AMS PMT, COMPASS, CDMD-OA, NDE, MBPS, PEO MLB, CSPT, GCSS, DPAS, DLA FLIS/WebFLIS, NAVSUP OneTouch. Each adapter includes system metadata, supported formats (CSV/XML/JSON/fixed-width), and mapped record types. Import methods: `import_csv()`, `import_xml()`, `import_json()`, `import_and_anchor()`, `list_dod_systems()`.
- **DoD Import Tool in Demo App** — New 19th ILS tool "DoD Import" in `demo-app/index.html`. File upload (drag-and-drop) and paste support for CSV/XML/JSON. Source system selector (13 systems), format selector, auto-detect record types. Demo import generator with realistic sample data for each system. Import, hash, anchor, and export workflows.
- **Metrics: Data Source Tracking** — `/api/metrics` now tracks `records_by_source` showing which DoD system each record was imported from (NSERC, CDMD-OA, MERLIN, etc.).

### Added — Documentation
- **DoD Database Integration Sections** — Added to TECHNICAL_SPECS.md, WHITEPAPER.md, and S4_SYSTEMS_EXECUTIVE_PROPOSAL.md. Includes 13-system compatibility table, import workflow (Export → Upload → Parse → Hash → Anchor → Integrate), SDK code examples.
- **Tamper Detection & Response Documentation** — Added to TECHNICAL_SPECS.md. Covers detection (MATCH/MISMATCH/NOT_FOUND), response pipeline (detect → alert → webhook → audit log → correct), and correction chain with `supersedes_tx` linking.

### Changed — API & Versions
- **OpenAPI Spec Updated to v3.9.7** — `openapi.json` version bumped from 3.8.0 to 3.9.7. Status example version bumped from 3.2.0 to 3.9.7. Added 7 new endpoint definitions: `/api/verify`, `/api/supply-chain-risk`, `/api/audit-reports`, `/api/contracts`, `/api/digital-thread`, `/api/predictive-maintenance` (these 5 existed in code but were undocumented). Total: 29 documented API endpoints.
- **API Version Strings Updated** — `api/index.py` version strings updated from 3.8.0/3.8.6/3.3.0 to 3.9.7 across status, health, and infrastructure endpoints.

- **How It Works visual inconsistency** — New panels (vault, docs, compliance) used plain `<details>` with no background color and different icon (`fa-circle-info` vs `fa-info-circle`). Now matches existing tool pattern with colored backgrounds, structured content sections, and consistent typography.
- **Metrics page blank on API failure** — Catch block only logged error. Now builds complete metrics dataset from localStorage with record type distribution, branch breakdown, and time-series data for all 5 chart views.
- **Landing page CTA mismatch** — Hero still said "ILS Workspace Analyzer" and button said "Launch ILS Analyzer" despite v3.6.0 rename.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Audit Record Vault** — New ILS Workspace panel (`hub-vault`). Every record anchored via any tool is automatically saved to client-side localStorage with content + SHA-256 hash + TX hash.
