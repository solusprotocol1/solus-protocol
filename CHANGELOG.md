## [3.7.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Audit Record Vault** — New ILS Workspace panel (`hub-vault`). Every record anchored via any tool is automatically saved to client-side localStorage with content + SHA-256 hash + TX hash. Searchable, filterable by time period, one-click re-verification of all records, CSV/XLSX export for auditor handoff. Zero server-side storage.
- **Defense Document Reference Library** — New ILS Workspace panel (`hub-docs`). 100+ real defense documents in separate `s4-assets/defense-docs.js` database: MIL-STDs (810H, 882E, 881F, 1388-2B, 461G, 1472H, etc.), OPNAVINSTs (4790.4F, 4441.12G, 5100.23H), DoD Directives (5000.01, 5000.02, 4140.01), NAVSEA/NAVAIR/NAVSUP manuals, FAR/DFARS clauses, NIST frameworks, Army/Air Force/Marine Corps/Coast Guard/Space Force regulations, DMSMS standards, CDRLs, ILS element references. Filterable by 7 branches and 17 categories with full-text search.
- **Compliance Scorecard** — New ILS Workspace panel (`hub-compliance`). Real-time multi-framework compliance calculator: CMMC Level 2 (25%), NIST 800-171 (20%), DFARS 252.204 (15%), FAR 46 Quality (15%), MIL-STD-1388 ILS (15%), DoDI 4245.15 DMSMS (10%). SVG ring chart with animated gradient arc, letter grades (A+ → F), color-coded bars, actionable recommendations, XLSX export, and anchor scorecard to XRPL.
- **Vault Auto-Save Integration** — All 9 anchor functions (`anchorRecord`, `anchorILSReport`, `anchorDMSMS`, `anchorReadiness`, `anchorParts`, `anchorROI`, `anchorLifecycle`, `anchorWarranty`, `anchorCompliance`) now auto-save to Audit Vault
- **Workspace Notification System** — Toast-style notifications for vault saves and bulk operations with auto-dismiss
- **Glassmorphism Design System** — `glass-card` with backdrop-filter blur, `hover-lift` transforms, `gradient-border` animated pseudo-elements, `pulse-dot` live indicators, `shimmer-text` loading states

## [3.6.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **ILS Workspace Consolidation** — All 9 ILS tools (Gap Analysis, Action Items, Calendar, DMSMS, Readiness, Parts Cross-Reference, ROI, Lifecycle Cost, Warranty) now contain FULL functionality inside the ILS Workspace panels — complete with all inputs, How It Works sections, Export buttons, and Anchor to XRPL buttons
- **Executive Proposal Overhaul** — Removed blockchain jargon, defined all acronyms on first use, added SAP/Oracle/Microsoft/Windchill competitive analysis, corrected military branch count to 6, expanded ILS Workspace tool table with standards alignment

### Changed
- **Renamed "ILS Intelligence Hub" → "ILS Workspace"** — all references across 15+ files (demo-app, landing page, metrics, transactions, search, SDK playground, OpenAPI spec, login page, CHANGELOG, WHITEPAPER, MAINNET_MIGRATION, PRODUCTION_READINESS)
- **Deleted standalone tool tabs** — removed all 7 standalone ILS tool tabs (Action Items, DMSMS, Readiness, Parts, ROI, Lifecycle, Warranty) and their 7 nav buttons; tools now live exclusively inside the ILS Workspace
- **Consolidated landing page explore cards** — replaced 8 individual tool cards (ILS Hub + 7 standalone tools) with single "ILS Workspace" card
- **Search index updated** — all tool search entries now point to `demo-app/#tabILS` instead of removed tab hashes
- **Cross-page links updated** — metrics.html and transactions.html cross-link cards renamed to "ILS Workspace"

### Fixed
- **YRBM naming** — corrected from "Yard Repair, Berthing & Messing" to "Yard, Repair, Berthing, & Messing" in demo-app and platforms database
- **Removed sync functions** — deleted `syncHubDmsms`, `syncHubReadiness`, `syncHubLifecycle`, `syncHubWarranty`, `syncROIInput` (no longer needed since workspace panels contain full tools)
- **Fixed broken element IDs** — hub-parts panel no longer references non-existent `searchParts()` or `partsNSN`/`partsName` elements; hub-roi no longer has `roiFTE` vs `roiFTEs` mismatch

### Removed
- Standalone tab panels: `tabActions`, `tabDMSMS`, `tabReadiness`, `tabParts`, `tabROI`, `tabLifecycle`, `tabWarranty`
- Standalone nav buttons for 7 removed tabs
- Hub sync functions that copied data between standalone tabs and hub mirrors

## [3.5.0] - 2026-02-15

- **Hub Panel Syncing** — Tools inside the ILS Workspace mirror data from standalone tabs (DMSMS stats, Readiness scores, Lifecycle costs, Warranty status)
- **Hub Action Items Breakdown** — Source-by-source breakdown showing open items per tool (DMSMS, Readiness, Warranty, etc.)
- **SDK Playground Expansion** — 6 new interactive examples: DMSMS Check, Readiness Calculator, ROI Analysis, Lifecycle Cost, Warranty Tracker, Action Items. Updated SDK Reference table (13 methods) and API Endpoints table (12 endpoints)

- `generateLifecycleActions()` now formats costs correctly using `formatCostM()` instead of hardcoded "$XB"

## [3.4.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Unified Action Items & Alerts Tab** — New consolidated tab replacing the standalone "How It Works" tab. Tracks actionable tasks from all 6 tools with severity-based sorting, filtering, localStorage persistence, and CSV export.
