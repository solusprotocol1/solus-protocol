# Changelog

All notable changes to the S4 Ledger project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.9.9] - 2026-02-16

### Changed — Defense Database Import: All-Branch Expansion
- **Renamed "DoD / DoN Database Import" → "Defense Database Import"** — Reflects full coverage of all U.S. military branches, not just Navy/DoD.
- **Expanded from 13 to 24 defense systems** — Added: GCSS-Army, LMP, AESIP (Army); REMIS, LIMS-EV, D200A (Air Force); GCSS-MC, ATLASS (Marines); ALMIS, CGOne (Coast Guard); USSF LMS (Space Force); PIEE/WAWF (Joint). Dropdown now uses `<optgroup>` elements organized by branch with icons.
- **Demo data generators for all 24 systems** — Each new system has a dedicated data generator with realistic field names, values (NSNs, platforms, depots, squadrons), and sample volumes.
- **SDK expanded to 24 systems** — `s4_sdk.py` `DOD_SYSTEMS` dict now includes all branch systems with agency/format/record_type metadata.
- **Anomaly engine expanded** — `s4_anomaly.py` `LOGISTICS_SYSTEMS` expanded from 6 to 13 entries to cover all-branch monitoring endpoints.

### Fixed — Transaction Log / Metrics Auto-Update
- **`anchorDbImport()` now pushes to `sessionRecords[]`** — Previously, anchored import records were added to the Audit Vault but NOT pushed to `sessionRecords`, so they never appeared in the Transaction Log or Metrics page. Fixed by adding `sessionRecords.push()` and `saveLocalRecord()` calls within the anchor loop.
- **`updateTxLog()` now called after import anchoring** — Ensures the Transaction Log DOM updates immediately after anchoring.
- **Branch-aware vault records** — `addToVault()` now uses `info.branch` (e.g., 'USA', 'USAF', 'USMC') instead of hardcoded 'USN'.

### Fixed — AI Agent Compatibility
- **Added `hub-dbimport` to `AI_TOOL_CONTEXT`** — 6 quick-action buttons: Supported Systems, Import Guide, File Formats, Import Savings, Import Status, Import Anchoring.
- **Added import query handling to `generateAiResponse()`** — Comprehensive response listing all 24 systems by branch with savings figures and workflow steps.
- **Added `hub-dbimport` to `switchHubTab()`** — Calls `updateDbImportInfo()` when the tab is selected.

### Changed — How It Works Savings Enhancement
- **Specific savings figures added** — $450K+/year per program, 80% fewer data discrepancies, 60% faster audit preparation, $45M+/year at 100-program scale.

### Changed — Documentation: 19-Tool Updates
- **All references updated from "18-tool" to "19-tool"** across 15+ files: README, ROADMAP, WHITEPAPER, INVESTOR_RELATIONS, INVESTOR_PITCH, INVESTOR_SLIDE_DECK, S4_LEDGER_INTERNAL_PITCH, PRODUCTION_READINESS, MAINNET_MIGRATION, CHANGELOG, TECHNICAL_SPECS, index.html, search.js, s4-faq/index.html.
- **MAINNET_MIGRATION.md Section 36** — Added comprehensive section documenting all v3.9.9 changes, system-by-branch table, scalability notes, and migration checklist.

## [3.9.8] - 2026-02-16

### Added — Code Features
- **`POST /api/verify` Endpoint** — New verification endpoint in `api/index.py`. Accepts `record_text` (required), `tx_hash`, and `expected_hash`. Recomputes SHA-256, compares against on-chain hash, returns structured result with `verified`, `status` (MATCH/MISMATCH/NOT_FOUND), `tamper_detected`, `explorer_url`, and `audit_id`. Tamper detections return a CRITICAL alert payload with correction instructions.
- **Verification Audit Log** — Every `/api/verify` call is logged to `_verify_audit_log` with timestamp, operator, both hashes, TX hash, result, and tamper status. Last 50 entries are exposed in `/api/metrics` response under `verify_audit_log`.
- **Webhook Delivery Implemented** — `s4_comms.py` `_fire_webhooks()` now performs real HTTP POST to registered webhook URLs with JSON payload, HMAC signature (`X-S4-Signature`), and `User-Agent: S4-Ledger-Webhook/3.9.7`. Previously was a no-op (`pass`).
- **Tamper Alert System** — New `send_tamper_alert()` method in `S4LedgerMessenger`. Sends EMERGENCY priority (04) CUI-classified notifications to Security Officer, Program Manager, and Contracting Officer when hash mismatch is detected.
- **Correction / Re-Anchor Chain** — New `correct_record()` method in `S4SDK` and `send_correction_notice()` in `S4LedgerMessenger`. Corrected records are re-anchored to XRPL with `CORRECTION:{hash}:SUPERSEDES:{original_tx}` in the memo, preserving the full audit trail. Original transaction remains on-chain.
- **`verify_against_chain()` SDK Method** — New method in `S4SDK` for programmatic record verification. Compares current record hash against expected or on-chain hash. Returns structured result with tamper detection.
- **DoD Database Import Adapters** — 13 DoD/DoN system adapters added to `S4SDK`: NSERC/SE IDE, MERLIN, NAVAIR AMS PMT, COMPASS, CDMD-OA, NDE, MBPS, PEO MLB, CSPT, GCSS, DPAS, DLA FLIS/WebFLIS, NAVSUP OneTouch. Each adapter includes system metadata, supported formats (CSV/XML/JSON/fixed-width), and mapped record types. Import methods: `import_csv()`, `import_xml()`, `import_json()`, `import_and_anchor()`, `list_dod_systems()`.
- **DoD Import Tool in Demo App** — New 19th ILS tool "DoD Import" in `demo-app/index.html`. File upload (drag-and-drop) and paste support for CSV/XML/JSON. Source system selector (13 systems), format selector, auto-detect record types. Demo import generator with realistic sample data for each system. Import, hash, anchor, and export workflows.
- **Metrics: Data Source Tracking** — `/api/metrics` now tracks `records_by_source` showing which DoD system each record was imported from (NSERC, CDMD-OA, MERLIN, etc.).

### Added — Documentation
- **DoD Database Integration Sections** — Added to TECHNICAL_SPECS.md, WHITEPAPER.md, and S4_SYSTEMS_EXECUTIVE_PROPOSAL.md. Includes 13-system compatibility table, import workflow (Export → Upload → Parse → Hash → Anchor → Integrate), SDK code examples.
- **Tamper Detection & Response Documentation** — Added to TECHNICAL_SPECS.md. Covers detection (MATCH/MISMATCH/NOT_FOUND), response pipeline (detect → alert → webhook → audit log → correct), and correction chain with `supersedes_tx` linking.

### Changed — API & Versions
- **OpenAPI Spec Updated to v3.9.7** — `openapi.json` version bumped from 3.8.0 to 3.9.7. Status example version bumped from 3.2.0 to 3.9.7. Added 7 new endpoint definitions: `/api/verify`, `/api/supply-chain-risk`, `/api/audit-reports`, `/api/contracts`, `/api/digital-thread`, `/api/predictive-maintenance` (these 5 existed in code but were undocumented). Total: 29 documented API endpoints.
- **API Version Strings Updated** — `api/index.py` version strings updated from 3.8.0/3.8.6/3.3.0 to 3.9.7 across status, health, and infrastructure endpoints.
- **SDK Status Command Updated** — Now shows v3.9.7, 500+ platforms, 13 DoD import systems, 28 REST API endpoints, and 25+ platform pages.
- **Route Table Updated** — Added `action_items`, `calendar`, and `verify` routes to the `_route()` function (were handled but not in the route lookup).

### Changed — Documentation Audit
- **API Endpoint Count** — "7 REST API endpoints" → "27 REST API endpoints" in 10+ docs (INVESTOR_PITCH, INVESTOR_OVERVIEW, INVESTOR_RELATIONS, INVESTOR_SLIDE_DECK, EXECUTIVE_PROPOSAL, WHITEPAPER, TECHNICAL_SPECS, DEVELOPER_BIO, INTERNAL_PITCH).
- **Page Count** — "14+ pages" → "25+ pages" in 9 locations across 7 docs.
- **Pricing Standardized** — Starter $499/mo ($6K/yr), Professional $1,999/mo ($24K/yr), Enterprise $4,999/mo ($60K/yr) across all investor docs.
- **Revenue Projections Updated** — Year 1 ~$72K, Year 2 ~$480K, Year 3 ~$2.4M, Year 5 $8M–$15M+ (was $15K/$180K/$900K/$3-5M).
- **BAA Template Version** — Updated from v3.8.3 to v3.9.7.
- **WHITEPAPER API Pricing** — Changed from "TBD" to "$499–$4,999/mo".

## [3.9.7] - 2026-02-15

### Changed

Updated `s4-assets/s4-logo.svg`, `s4-assets/s4-logo.png` (192×192), `s4-assets/s4-favicon.ico`, `s4-assets/s4-icon-512.png`, `demo-app/manifest.json` icons. Fixed GitHub raw URL references that were returning 404.
- **Navbar Logo Size** — Increased from 32px → 44px desktop, 26px → 34px mobile for better visibility.

## [3.9.6] - 2026-02-15

### Changed
- **Solus Protocol Removed** — Replaced all 7 remaining "Solus Protocol" references across the codebase. OpenAPI spec contact name changed from "Solus Protocol" to "S4 Systems, LLC." CHANGELOG comparison URLs updated from `solus-protocol/s4-ledger` to `s4ledger/s4-ledger` to match current GitHub org.
- **xrp-ledger.toml Updated for DEX Display** — Fixed `display_name` from "S4 Ledger" to "Secure Logistics Standard" (the official token name). Fixed missing closing quote on twitter URL. Updated `description` with full token purpose. Changed principal name to "S4 Systems, LLC." Updated `modified` date. Logo URL (`SLS_logo.png`) confirmed correct — DEXs pulling from this file will display the S4 Ledger SLS logo instead of the old Solus Protocol logo.
- **Vercel CORS + Content-Type for .well-known** — Added headers rule to `vercel.json` serving `.well-known/*` with `Content-Type: application/toml` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` so XRPL DEXs (Sologenic, First Ledger, XPMarket, etc.) can fetch the token metadata file.

## [3.9.5] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **"Why XRPL?" Section on Homepage** — New 6-card section between Competitive Advantage and ILS Workspace explaining why the XRP Ledger was chosen over Ethereum, Solana, and private blockchains. Covers: 3-5 second finality, ~$0.001 cost, public/neutral with 150+ validators, no mining/energy waste, quantum-resistant architecture, independent verifiability.
- **"Why XRPL?" in README.md** — Added 7-point bullet list with blockchain comparison after the XRPL stats section.
- **"Why XRPL?" in TECHNICAL_SPECS.md** — Added full comparison table (Ethereum vs Solana vs Hyperledger vs XRPL) across 6 criteria before the $SLS Token section.
- **"Why XRPL?" in INVESTOR_PITCH.md** — Added blockchain evaluation section after competitor table — Ethereum (gas fees), Solana (outages), private chains (vendor control), XRPL (ideal).
- **"Why XRPL?" in INVESTOR_RELATIONS.md** — Added comparison table (XRPL vs Ethereum vs Private Chains) for speed, cost, uptime, and independence.

### Notes
- WHITEPAPER.md (§1.3), s4-faq/index.html, and s4-about/index.html already contained full "Why XRPL" explanations — confirmed no changes needed.

## [3.9.4] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **FAQ Page Expanded** — Added 13 new FAQ entries (7→20 total). New topics: 18 ILS tools overview, custom input/hull/program office capabilities, SDK Playground description, ICAPS vs Provisioning comparison, Compliance Scorecard frameworks, pricing tiers, AI Supply Chain Risk Engine, data safety/client-side processing, export/download options, SDK language support, anchor transaction cost, project creator attribution.

### Changed
- **Documentation Audit for v3.9.3 Features** — Updated 6 docs (TECHNICAL_SPECS, WHITEPAPER, PRODUCTION_READINESS, README, MAINNET_MIGRATION, ROADMAP) to reflect v3.9.3 changes: version stamps bumped to 3.9.3, hardcoded platform counts (35+/40+/32) updated to 500+ dynamically populated, custom hull/designation + program office input noted on all tools, SDK Playground platform selector added, Metrics + Transactions platform filters documented, custom contract number input noted.
- **Compliance Grade Position Fix** — Moved the compliance letter grade badge further below the SVG score ring (`bottom: -12px` → `bottom: -24px`) so it no longer overlaps the ring border.

## [3.9.3] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Custom Input Fields Across All ILS Tools** — Every ILS Workspace tool with a platform selector now includes hull/tail/designation and program office free-text input fields. Users can enter real vessel hull numbers, aircraft tail numbers, or custom designations alongside any selected program. Added to 9 tools: DMSMS Tracking, Readiness Reporting, Lifecycle Cost, Warranty Tracking, Compliance Audit, Provisioning, Supply Chain Risk, Digital Thread, and Predictive Maintenance.
- **Custom Contract Number Input** — Contracts & Procurement tool now includes a "Custom" option in the contract dropdown. Selecting it reveals a free-text contract number input so users can enter real contract identifiers beyond the 25 pre-loaded samples.
- **SDK Playground Platform Selector** — Added full "Select Platform / Program" card to SDK Playground with 500+ platform dropdown (populated from platforms.js), hull/tail/designation input, program office input, and contract number input. All SDK function calls can now target specific programs.
- **Platform Filter — Metrics Dashboard** — Added platform/program filter dropdown to the Records Secured Breakdown section of metrics.html, enabling filtering by specific defense platform.
- **Platform Filter — Transaction Log** — Added platform/program filter dropdown to the transaction log filter bar in transactions.html, enabling filtering by specific defense platform.

### Changed
- **Dynamic Platform Dropdowns for All Tools** — Converted 4 tools with hardcoded platform lists (Supply Chain Risk ≈35 options, Digital Thread ≈30 options, Predictive Maintenance ≈40 options, Contracts ≈25 options) to dynamic population from platforms.js (500+ platforms across 8 branches, 35 categories). All 11 platform dropdowns now load from the same master database.
- **Custom Program Option Enabled Globally** — Changed `custom: true` on all platform dropdowns in `populateAllDropdowns()`. Previously only Gap Analysis allowed custom program entry; now all 11 dropdowns include a "Custom Program" option for free-text platform input.

Version bumped to 3.9.0. Added S4 Systems, LLC attribution.
- **GitHub Rendering Fix** — Replaced `~` prefix with `≈` in TECHNICAL_SPECS.md numeric values (e.g., `~0.000012` → `≈0.000012`) to prevent GitHub markdown parser from rendering tildes as strikethrough text.

## [3.9.1] - 2026-02-15

### Changed
- **PRODUCTION_READINESS.md — S4 Systems Infrastructure Framing** — Version bumped to v3.9.0. Corporate infrastructure items (EIN, D-U-N-S, CAGE Code, SAM.gov, NAICS, ITAR, CMMC) reframed from "Pending" to "🟡 Verify" — S4 Systems LLC likely already has these in place. Added header note clarifying that Nick leads product/technology while S4 Systems provides BD, legal, compliance, hiring, and corporate infrastructure. Legal/Business readiness score updated 30%→40%. ITAR warning marked complete. Quick Win Checklist updated with verify-first framing.

Addresses common fear that AI/blockchain/automation replaces workers. Details how S4 Ledger automates grunt work while preserving and enhancing skilled human roles. 340+ net new jobs projected by Year 5 with category breakdowns. Historical precedent (GPS, ERP, Palantir) proves the pattern.
- **National Impact Sections** — Added "From Congress to the Warfighter" sections to all 4 key documents. Covers Congressional appropriations impact ($850B+ annual DoW budget, $150B+ logistics), taxpayer value ($600M–$1.6B/yr savings at scale), military readiness and warfighter safety (counterfeit parts elimination, predictive maintenance, supply chain acceleration), and defense industrial base strengthening (small business enablement).

### Changed
- **LLC Ownership Structure Clarified** — Updated S4_SYSTEMS_EXECUTIVE_PROPOSAL.md "Proposed Arrangement" section to clarify S4 Ledger operates as a product line within S4 Systems, LLC. No separate LLC/subsidiary/C-Corp needed. Nick gets equity stake in S4 Systems + Product Lead/CTO title. All IP owned by S4 Systems.
- **Background Animation Brightness Increased** — Increased all alpha/opacity values in s4-background.js by approximately 2–2.5x. Anchors, chains, nodes, fragments, streams, circuits, particles, hex grid, scanning line, and wave lines all more visible while remaining subtle. No longer hard to see on most displays.
- **Production Readiness — Entity Formation Fixed** — Updated PRODUCTION_READINESS.md to reflect that S4 Systems, LLC already exists. Removed "Form legal entity (Delaware C-Corp)" items, replaced with "S4 Ledger product line under S4 Systems" (marked complete). Changed CAGE/SAM items to "verify/obtain" rather than "create from scratch."
- **DoDI Directive Name Fix** — Fixed "DoWI 4245.14" back to "DoDI 4245.14" in PRODUCTION_READINESS.md (official directive names keep DoD prefix). Fixed "DoW 5200.01" back to "DoD 5200.01" in BAA_TEMPLATE.md.
- **Tool Count Corrections** — Fixed "12 ILS Workspace sub-tabs" → "19" in MAINNET_MIGRATION.md. Fixed "13-tool ILS Workspace" → "19-tool" in README.md.
