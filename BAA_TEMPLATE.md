# S4 Ledger — Defense Data Integrity Agreement (DDIA)

**Template — Version 2.0**

---

## Purpose

This Defense Data Integrity Agreement (DDIA) establishes the terms under which S4 Ledger provides hash-based integrity verification services for defense logistics data. This template is intended for use between S4 Ledger (the "Service Provider") and defense contractors, government agencies, or their authorized representatives (the "Customer").

---

## 1. Service Description

S4 Ledger provides **hash anchoring services** for defense logistics records, including but not limited to:

- Supply chain records (receipts, certificates of conformance, chain of custody)
- Maintenance records (3-M, SCLSIS, MRC completions, inspection results)
- Technical data packages (TDP revisions, engineering drawings)
- Contract deliverables (CDRLs, DIDs, SOW documentation)
- Configuration baselines (hardware/software configuration items)
- Audit artifacts (inspection reports, compliance evidence)
- DMSMS obsolescence tracking and resolution reports
- Operational readiness assessments (RAM — Reliability, Availability, Maintainability)
- Lifecycle cost estimates and warranty contract status
- ROI analyses and cost-benefit calculations
- ILS Gap Analysis reports (MIL-STD-1388 compliance checklists)
- Compliance Scorecards (CMMC, NIST 800-171, DFARS, FAR 46, MIL-STD-1388)

### 1.1 Audit Record Vault

All anchored records are automatically stored in the **S4 Audit Record Vault**, a client-side record store that pairs the original record content with its SHA-256 hash and XRPL transaction hash. The Vault enables:

- Instant search and filtering of all anchored records by type, date, or content
- One-click re-verification of any stored record against its on-chain hash
- CSV/XLSX export of complete audit trails for inspector review
- Zero server-side data storage — all Vault data resides in the Customer's browser

### 1.2 Defense Document Reference Library

S4 Ledger includes a searchable **Defense Document Reference Library** containing 100+ real MIL-STDs, OPNAVINSTs, DoD Directives, NAVSEA/NAVAIR technical manuals, FAR/DFARS clauses, and NIST cybersecurity frameworks. This library is for reference only — no classified content is stored or transmitted.

### 1.3 Compliance Scorecard

The **Compliance Scorecard** tool calculates real-time compliance posture across CMMC Level 2, NIST 800-171, DFARS 252.204-7012, FAR 46 Quality, MIL-STD-1388 ILS, and DoDI 4245.15 DMSMS management — based on actual workspace activity (anchored records, action items, tool usage).

## 2. Data Handling

### 2.1 Hash-Only Architecture

S4 Ledger processes **only SHA-256 hashes** of Customer data. At no point does S4 Ledger:

- Receive, store, process, or transmit the original data
- Access Customer systems or databases directly
- Retain any information from which original data can be derived

### 2.2 What Is Anchored

| Stored On-Chain | NOT Stored Anywhere |
|---|---|
| 64-character SHA-256 hash | Original documents or files |
| XRPL transaction timestamp | Part numbers, NSNs, serial numbers |
| Transaction metadata (record type, non-sensitive tags) | Personnel names, SSNs, PII |
| | Contract dollar amounts |
| | Classified or CUI-marked content |
| | ITAR/EAR-controlled technical data |

### 2.3 Hash Generation

Hashing is performed **on the Customer's infrastructure** using the S4 Ledger SDK. The hash is generated locally before any data leaves the Customer's network boundary. Only the resulting 64-character hash string is transmitted to the XRP Ledger.

---

## 3. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)

### 3.1 CUI Handling

S4 Ledger's hash-only architecture ensures that **no CUI is stored, processed, or transmitted** by the service. SHA-256 hashes are irreversible — the original data cannot be recovered from the hash.

### 3.2 NIST 800-171 Alignment

S4 Ledger's architecture aligns with NIST SP 800-171 requirements for CUI protection:

| NIST 800-171 Family | S4 Ledger Alignment |
|---|---|
| Access Control (3.1) | No CUI accessible — hash-only |
| Audit & Accountability (3.3) | Provides immutable audit trail |
| Configuration Management (3.4) | Anchors baseline integrity |
| Identification & Authentication (3.5) | XRPL wallet-based authentication |
| System & Communications Protection (3.13) | TLS 1.3 for all transmissions |
| System & Information Integrity (3.14) | Core service — integrity verification |

### 3.3 CMMC Compatibility

S4 Ledger is designed to be compatible with CMMC Level 2+ environments. The service supplements, rather than replaces, a Customer's CMMC compliance posture. The built-in **Compliance Scorecard** provides real-time visibility into the Customer's compliance posture across CMMC, NIST 800-171, DFARS, FAR 46, MIL-STD-1388, and DoDI 4245.15 frameworks — based on actual anchoring and tool usage activity.

### 3.4 ILS Workspace Tools

S4 Ledger v4.0 includes a comprehensive ILS Workspace with 20 integrated tools:

1. **Gap Analysis** — MIL-STD-1388 compliance checklists for 462+ defense platforms
2. **Action Items** — Task tracking with priority, assignment, and deadline management
3. **Calendar** — Event scheduling with anchor-date tracking
4. **DMSMS Tracker** — Obsolescence monitoring and resolution planning
5. **Readiness Calculator** — RAM (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability) analysis
6. **Parts Cross-Reference** — NSN/CAGE/FSC lookup across all programs
7. **ROI Calculator** — Cost-benefit analysis with 5-year projections
8. **Lifecycle Estimator** — Total ownership cost modeling

## 4. DFARS 252.204-7012 Compliance

Since S4 Ledger does not receive, store, or process Covered Defense Information (CDI), the DFARS clause requirements for CDI protection do not apply to the hashed data on the XRP Ledger. Customers remain responsible for protecting CDI within their own systems.

---

## 5. ITAR / EAR Considerations

### 5.1 No Technical Data On-Chain

S4 Ledger does not transmit, store, or make accessible any technical data as defined under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR, 22 CFR 120-130) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR, 15 CFR 730-774).

### 5.2 Customer Responsibility

Customers are responsible for ensuring that:

- Only SHA-256 hashes are submitted to the S4 Ledger SDK
- No ITAR/EAR-controlled data is included in transaction memo fields
- Hash generation occurs within appropriately controlled environments

---

## 6. Classification

### 6.1 No Classified Data

S4 Ledger is designed for **unclassified** defense logistics data only. This service **must not** be used to hash, anchor, or verify:

- Classified information at any level (CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET, SCI)
- Classified system configurations or architectures
- Any data requiring protection under DoD 5200.01

### 6.2 Customer Obligation

The Customer warrants that no classified data will be processed through the S4 Ledger service.

---

## 7. Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention | Location |
|---|---|---|
| XRPL transaction hashes | Permanent (immutable) | XRP Ledger (public) |
| Customer account information | Duration of agreement + 1 year | S4 Ledger systems |
| Original data / documents | Not applicable | Customer systems only |
| SDK usage logs | 90 days | Customer's local environment |

---

## 8. Incident Response

In the event of a security incident affecting S4 Ledger systems:

1. **Detection & Containment:** Within 1 hour of discovery
2. **Customer Notification:** Within 24 hours
3. **Impact Assessment:** Within 72 hours
4. **Remediation Plan:** Within 7 days
5. **Post-Incident Report:** Within 30 days

Note: Since S4 Ledger does not hold Customer data, the impact scope of any incident is limited to service availability, not data exposure.

---

## 9. Term & Termination

### 9.1 Term

This Agreement is effective for [______] months from the date of execution, with automatic renewal unless either party provides 30 days' written notice.

### 9.2 Effect of Termination

Upon termination:

- Customer's SDK access keys are deactivated
- No data deletion is required (hashes on XRPL are permanent and non-sensitive)
- Customer retains the ability to independently verify any previously anchored records using any XRPL node or explorer

---

## 10. Liability & Warranty

### 10.1 Service Warranty

S4 Ledger warrants that:

- Hashes will be anchored to the XRP Ledger accurately
- The SDK will generate SHA-256 hashes consistent with NIST FIPS 180-4
