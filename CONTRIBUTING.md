## Development Standards

### Code Style
- **Python:** PEP 8, type hints on all public functions
- **HTML/CSS/JS:** Consistent with existing S4 Ledger site style
- **Markdown:** ATX headings, tables for structured data

### Commit Messages
```
type(scope): brief description

feat(sdk): add batch anchoring for multiple records
fix(verify): handle expired XRPL node connections
docs(readme): update SDK quick start examples
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`

### Testing
- All new Python code must include pytest tests
- Maintain or increase test coverage
- Test both success and error paths

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch:** Create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Changes:** Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
3. **Tests:** Ensure all tests pass
4. **Description:** Include:
   - What the change does
   - Why it's needed
   - Any defense logistics context (e.g., which ILS element it supports)
5. **Review:** PRs require at least one review before merge

---

## What We're Looking For

- SDK improvements (new record types, batch operations, error handling)
- Documentation improvements (use case guides, integration examples)
- Security hardening
- Test coverage expansion
- CLI tool enhancements
- REST API development
- Integration examples (3-M, GCSS, DPAS, etc.)

---

## Reporting Issues

- **Bugs:** Open a GitHub issue with reproduction steps
- **Security vulnerabilities:** Email security@s4ledger.com (do NOT open a public issue)
- **Feature requests:** Open a GitHub issue with the `enhancement` label
