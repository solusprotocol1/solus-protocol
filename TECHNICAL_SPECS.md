# S4 Ledger: Technical Specifications
*Version 4.0.0 — A product line of S4 Systems, LLC*

**Architecture: Hash Anchoring via XRP Ledger (XRPL)**

## 1. Hashing Algorithm

S4 Ledger uses **SHA-256** (NIST FIPS 180-4) for all record fingerprints.

- **Input:** Any data — normalized JSON, PDF binary, file contents, serialized record
- **Output:** 64-character hexadecimal string (256 bits)
- **Properties:** Collision-resistant, irreversible, deterministic

## 2. XRPL Transaction Structure

S4 Ledger utilizes the `Memos` field in a standard XRPL transaction to anchor data:

```json
{
  "TransactionType": "AccountSet",
  "Account": "S4_ISSUER_ADDRESS",
  // No Destination needed — AccountSet modifies own account
  // Memo contains the SHA-256 hash
  "Memos": [
    {
      "Memo": {
        "MemoType": "HEX('defense.anchor')",
        "MemoData": "SHA-256 HASH (64 hex chars)",
        "MemoFormat": "HEX('text/plain')"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Record Types

| Type Code | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `supply_chain_receipt` | Part receipt / chain of custody | NSN lot acceptance |
| `maintenance_3m` | 3-M / SCLSIS maintenance record | MRC completion |
| `cdrl_delivery` | Contract deliverable submission | CDRL A003 delivery |

### Why XRPL?

S4 Ledger evaluated Ethereum, Solana, Hyperledger, and private blockchain platforms before selecting the XRP Ledger:

| Criteria | Ethereum | Solana | Hyperledger | XRPL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Finality** | 12+ minutes | 400ms (but outage-prone) | Varies | **3-5 seconds** |
| **Cost/tx** | $5–$50+ | ~$0.00025 | Infrastructure cost $500K+ | **≈$0.000024** |
| **Uptime** | 99.9% | ~98% (multiple outages) | Operator-dependent | **99.99%+ since 2012** |
| **Public/Neutral** | Yes | Yes | ❌ Private/vendor-controlled | **Yes (150+ validators)** |
| **Energy** | Proof-of-Stake | Proof-of-Stake/History | Varies | **Federated consensus (negligible energy)** |
| **Defense suitability** | High fees prohibit volume | Reliability concerns | No independent verification | **Ideal: fast, cheap, public, reliable** |

Private blockchains (Hyperledger, Guardtime KSI) defeat the purpose of independent verification — they're controlled by a single entity. Ethereum's gas fees ($5–$50+) make high-volume defense anchoring economically unviable. XRPL provides the speed, cost, neutrality, and reliability required for defense-grade audit trails.

## 8. $SLS Token

| **Treasury** | `rMLmkrxpadq5z6oTDmq8GhQj9LKjf1KLqJ` (receives 0.01 SLS/anchor) |
| **Fee per Anchor** | ~0.01 SLS |

## 9. Security

- **No data on-chain** — only SHA-256 hashes
- **No CUI/CDI exposure** — architecture makes it impossible
- **No key storage** — wallet seeds remain with the user
- **No telemetry** — SDK does not collect usage data
- **Input validation** — all inputs sanitized before processing

## 10. Compliance Alignment

|---|---|
| NIST SP 800-171 | Aligned |
| CMMC Level 2 | **In Progress** — S4 Systems, LLC |
| DFARS 252.204-7012 | Compliant (no CDI on-chain) |
| NIST SP 800-53 (AU) | Immutable audit trail |
| FedRAMP | Planned (Phase 5) |
| FIPS 180-4 | SHA-256 compliant |

## DoD / DoN Database Integration

S4 Ledger provides native import adapters for 13+ DoD and DoN logistics information systems. Data exported from these systems can be ingested in CSV, XML, or JSON format, automatically mapped to S4 Ledger record types, hashed with SHA-256, and optionally anchored to the XRPL blockchain.

### Import Workflow

1. **Export** — Extract data from the DoD system in CSV, XML, or JSON
2. **Upload** — Load the file into S4 Ledger via the ILS Workspace "DoD Import" tool or the SDK `import_and_anchor()` method
3. **Parse & Map** — S4 automatically detects the format and maps fields to the appropriate record types
4. **Hash** — Each record is individually hashed with SHA-256
5. **Anchor** — Optionally anchor each hash to the XRPL blockchain for immutable verification
6. **Integrate** — Imported data flows into all 20 ILS tools: DMSMS tracking, readiness, parts cross-reference, audit vault, etc.

### SDK Import Methods

```python
sdk = S4SDK(wallet_seed="sEd...", network="mainnet")

# List supported systems
systems = sdk.list_dod_systems()

# Import CSV from CDMD-OA
result = sdk.import_csv(csv_text, "cdmd_oa")

# Import and auto-anchor
result = sdk.import_and_anchor(file_text, "merlin", file_format="csv", anchor=True)
```

## Tamper Detection & Response

S4 Ledger provides a complete tamper detection, notification, and correction pipeline.

### Detection

Every record anchored to the XRPL includes its SHA-256 hash in the transaction memo. To verify integrity, the `POST /api/verify` endpoint (or `sdk.verify_against_chain()`) recomputes the hash of the current record and compares it against the on-chain value.

- **MATCH** — Record is intact. Hash matches on-chain proof.
- **MISMATCH** — Tamper detected. Current data differs from anchored version.
- **NOT_FOUND** — No on-chain record found for the given transaction hash.

### Response Pipeline

1. **Detect** — Verification returns `tamper_detected: true`
2. **Alert** — System sends CRITICAL priority notification via `send_tamper_alert()` to Security Officer, Program Manager, and Contracting Officer
3. **Webhook** — All registered webhook endpoints receive the tamper alert via HTTP POST with HMAC signature
4. **Audit Log** — Every verification attempt (pass or fail) is recorded in the verification audit trail with operator ID, timestamp, both hashes, and result
5. **Correct** — The `correct_record()` SDK method or the correction API re-anchors the corrected record with a `supersedes_tx` link to the original, preserving the full chain of custody

### Correction Chain

When a tampered record is corrected:
- The corrected version is re-anchored to the XRPL with a new transaction
- The memo includes `CORRECTION:{new_hash}:SUPERSEDES:{original_tx}` linking the two
- The original transaction remains on-chain as part of the immutable audit trail
- A correction notice is sent via the comms module to all stakeholders
