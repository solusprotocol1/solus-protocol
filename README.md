# S4 Ledger

**Immutable Defense Logistics on the XRP Ledger**

S4 Ledger provides tamper-proof audit trails for defense supply chains, technical data, maintenance records, and contract deliverables using SHA-256 hash anchoring on the XRP Ledger.

No sensitive data touches the blockchain — ever. Only cryptographic hashes.

## S4 Systems — Two Products, One Mission

S4 Systems offers two complementary products for defense logistics:

- **S4 Ledger** — The trust and intelligence layer. 20+ tools for risk analysis, readiness, compliance, audit, SBOM management, GFP tracking, CDRL validation, contract extraction, provenance, and AI-powered logistics intelligence. Every record is hash-anchored to the XRP Ledger for tamper-proof verification.
- **HarborLink** — The collaboration portal (in development). Tools for parts cross-reference, contract lifecycle management, provisioning, warranty tracking, configuration management, scheduling, and defense database import/export. Will integrate with S4 Ledger.

Together, they provide a complete ILS platform. S4 Ledger focuses on analysis, compliance, and immutable record integrity. HarborLink focuses on day-to-day logistics workflows and cross-program collaboration.

## How It Works

```
Event → Hash → Anchor → Verify
```

1. **Event occurs** — A part is received, maintenance is performed, a CDRL is delivered, a TDP is updated
2. **SHA-256 hash generated** — A one-way cryptographic fingerprint of the record. No data leaves your system.
3. **Hash anchored on XRPL** — The hash is stored immutably on the XRP Ledger with a timestamp
4. **Anyone can verify** — Re-hash the original data and compare against the ledger. No proprietary tools required.

Cost per anchor: **0.01 SLS** (~$0.01) + XRPL base fee (~$0.001)  
Confirmation time: **3-5 seconds**  
XRPL uptime: **99.99%**

- **📄 Documentation Updated** — README, version bumped to 5.1.0

### Why XRPL?

We chose the XRP Ledger over Ethereum, Solana, and private blockchains for defense logistics:

- **Speed:** 3-5 second finality vs Ethereum's 12+ minutes
- **Cost:** ~$0.001 per anchor vs Ethereum's $5-$50+ gas fees
- **Reliability:** 99.99% uptime since 2012 — over 13 years of uninterrupted operation
- **Neutrality:** Public ledger with 150+ independent validators — no vendor lock-in
- **Energy:** Federated consensus (not proof-of-work) — negligible energy per transaction
- **Verifiability:** Anyone can verify an anchor on the public XRPL explorer — no proprietary tools required

Private blockchains (Hyperledger, Guardtime) defeat the purpose — they're controlled by a single vendor and aren't independently verifiable. XRPL provides the speed, cost, and neutrality required for defense-grade audit trails.

## $SLS Token — Secure Logistics Standard

$SLS is the utility token powering every verification on the S4 Ledger network.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Token Code** | SLS |
| **Blockchain** | XRP Ledger |
| **Issuer** | `r95GyZac4butvVcsTWUPpxzekmyzaHsTA5` |
| **Total Supply** | 100,000,000 SLS |
| **Treasury Wallet** | `raWL7nYZkuXMUurHcp5ZXkABfVgStdun51` |
| **Treasury** | `rMLmkrxpadq5z6oTDmq8GhQj9LKjf1KLqJ` (receives 0.01 SLS per anchor) |
| **Fee per Anchor** | 0.01 SLS per anchor |

$SLS is a utility token — not equity or an investment contract.

## Quick Start (Python SDK)

```bash
pip install s4-ledger-sdk
```

### Anchor a Record

```python
from s4_sdk import S4Ledger

ledger = S4Ledger(wallet_seed="sYourXRPLSecret")

result = ledger.anchor_hash(
    data="CDRL-DI-MGMT-81466-Rev3-2026-02-12.pdf",
    record_type="cdrl_delivery",
    metadata={"contract": "N00024-26-C-5500", "cdrl": "A003"}
)

print(f"TX Hash: {result['tx_hash']}")
print(f"Ledger: {result['ledger_index']}")
```

### Verify a Record

```python
verification = ledger.verify_hash(
    data="CDRL-DI-MGMT-81466-Rev3-2026-02-12.pdf",
    tx_hash=result['tx_hash']
)

print(f"Verified: {verification['verified']}")
print(f"Anchored: {verification['timestamp']}")
```
