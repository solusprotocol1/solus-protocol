## Partner Integration

See PARTNER_ONBOARDING.md for step-by-step integration. Sample API endpoints and BAA template provided.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see 'Invalid checksum', regenerate your XRPL seed and ensure it's 51 characters.
- For fiat conversion, ensure gateway_issuer is set and trustlines are established.
- For compliance, see HIPAA_COMPLIANCE.md, GDPR_COMPLIANCE.md, and SECURITY.md.

## Quickstart Flows

### Anchor a Record
```python
from solus_sdk import SolusSDK
sdk = SolusSDK(wallet_seed="sEdYourTestnetSeedHere", testnet=True)
record = "Patient: John Doe\nDOB: 1985-03-15\nVisit: 2026-01-20\nDiagnosis: Hypertension, mild"
result = sdk.secure_patient_record(record_text=record, encrypt_first=True, fiat_mode=False)
print(result)
```

### Verify a Record Hash
```python
hash_val = sdk.create_record_hash(record)
print("Record hash:", hash_val)
```

- `SOLUS_API_KEY` (optional): For production/fiat mode

---

## Security Notes

- **Never commit real seeds, secrets, or patient data to version control.**
- Use `.env` files or environment variables for sensitive config.
- All hashes are SHA-256; no PHI is ever stored on-chain.

## Overview

Solus Protocol is a decentralized infrastructure layer built to bridge legacy Electronic Health Records (EHR) with the transparency of the XRP Ledger. By anchoring cryptographic fingerprints of medical data, we enable real-time validation, auditability, and tamper-proof custody without exposing sensitive Protected Health Information (PHI). 

**NOTE: In the full product phase, the SDK will support both EHR integration mode and standalone mode — allowing providers without existing EHRs to use Solus as a complete, self-contained solution.**

Solus Protocol is designed to establish the standard for secure, patient-controlled medical data integrity in healthcare. We address critical challenges in healthcare data management, such as fragmentation, insecurity, and lack of patient ownership, which cost the US healthcare system approximately $300 billion annually due to mismanagement, redundancies, and inefficiencies (industry estimates, e.g., Persivia 2024 analysis).

Our mission is to empower patients with true data sovereignty while enabling providers (e.g., hospitals like MUSC and SC clinics) to access verifiable, tamper-proof records compliantly and efficiently. Starting with a South Carolina-first approach (headquartered in Mount Pleasant, SC), we prioritize local pilots to drive economic impact before national expansion.

This repository contains a prototype SDK (Software Development Kit) demonstrating core functionality: hashing medical records for integrity, optional encryption for privacy, and storing hashes on XRPL using $SLS as a utility token for fees and incentives. This prototype showcases our progress as an early-stage project and serves as a foundation for production development.

## Key Highlights for Investors, Stakeholders, and VCs

**Problem Solved:** Healthcare data silos lead to errors, delays, privacy breaches, and high costs. Solus fixes this with decentralized integrity, reducing redundancies (e.g., saving providers 20-30% on admin costs) and enabling personalized care.
Differentiation: XRPL's speed (3-5s settlements), low costs (<1 cent/tx), and scalability outperform Ethereum-based competitors. True patient sovereignty + SC-focused entry for quick traction.

**Traction/Validation:** Live mainnet with $SLS token, treasury secured (30M locked), Axelar bridge in progress. Planned SC pilots with MUSC/clinics for real-world testing.
Revenue Model: Primary: SDK subscriptions ($5K-50K/year per provider). Secondary: $SLS utility fees (micro-payments for actions) + incentives. Projected: $250K-600K Year 2, scaling to $12M-60M by Year 5.

**Compliance Focus:** Off-chain PHI storage, encryption, and hash-only on-chain design supports HIPAA. $SLS framed as pure utility (not security) to avoid SEC issues—legal opinions planned with funding.

**VC Appeal:** $11B blockchain healthcare market (2024) → $200B+ by 2030 (CAGR 60%+). Recurring SaaS revenue + network growth in a defensible niche.

## 🛠️ Protocol Core Features
* **Immutable Anchoring:** Leverages XRPL transaction memos to create permanent clinical audit trails.
* **Zero-Knowledge Privacy:** Anchors SHA-256 hashes only—ensuring zero patient data is leaked on-chain.
* **Low-Latency Verification:** Validates the integrity of millions of records in seconds using XRPL's high-throughput consensus.
* **Enterprise Interoperability:** Designed for seamless API integration with Epic, Cerner, and other major EHR providers.

## How Solus Protocol Works (Utility): 

### Step 1: The Problem in Detail

Healthcare providers struggle with fragmented data across silos (e.g., different EHR systems like Epic/Cerner), leading to:
* Medical errors/delays (e.g., missing records cause redundant tests, costing $100-500/patient).
* Privacy breaches (rising cyber threats; fines $50K-2M/incident).
* No patient control (patients can't easily own/share data).

In SC, this impacts institutions like MUSC (2.4M patients). Solus solves this with blockchain-secured hashes for verifiable integrity.

### Step 2: Core Solution – Hashing for Integrity

We start by creating a "fingerprint" (hash) of the medical record. This ensures immutability: Any change alters the hash, proving tampering. Sensitive PHI stays off-chain (local/encrypted storage) for compliance.

### Example Code for Hashing:

    import hashlib  # Built-in Python tool for hashing

    # Function to hash a patient record
    def create_record_hash(record_text):
        # Turn text into a secure, unique "fingerprint" (hash)
        hash_object = hashlib.sha256(record_text.encode())
        return hash_object.hexdigest()  # Outputs a long string like 'abc123...'
    
    *Example with test data*
    test_record = """
    Patient ID: TEST-987654
    Name: John Doe (fictional test patient)
    Date of Visit: January 19, 2026
    Blood Pressure: 118/76
    Heart Rate: 72 bpm
    Notes: Routine checkup. No issues detected. This is dummy data for Solus Protocol testing only.
    """
    hash_result = create_record_hash(test_record)
    print("Secure Hash (Fingerprint):", hash_result)  # Example: 'd4e567f...etc'

### Step 3: The SDK – Provider Integration Tool

The SDK is a Python library that providers install to integrate Solus into their systems (e.g., Epic/Cerner via APIs). It handles hashing, encryption (for privacy), and XRPL storage. Providers subscribe (USD via Stripe) for access—freemium for betas.

### Step 4: Real-World Use & $SLS Utility

* **Provider Implementation:** Install via [pip install solus-sdk] (once packaged). Setup trust line once. Call [secure_patient_record()] in their EHR workflow—hashes/stores automatically.

* **$SLS as Fuel:** In [store_hash_with_sls_fee], $SLS deducts for the transaction (utility payment to treasury—your revenue). Providers pay USD subscriptions; SDK auto-handles $SLS conversion. Rebates encourage use. Trading adds liquidity but revenue is from fees.

* **Path to Profitability:** Subscriptions for SDK access; $SLS fees (10-20% to treasury) scale with adoption. Pilots prove value, leading to paid tiers.

### Installation

Install dependencies: [pip install cryptography xrpl-py]
Run the code: Import and use as shown.

### Compliance & Legal

Design supports HIPAA (off-chain PHI, encryption). $SLS as utility token (not security). Funding will enable full audits.
