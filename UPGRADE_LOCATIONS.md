## PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE

The platform uses a **Hub → Section → Tab** navigation model:

- **Landing Page** — hero, feature cards, footer (public-facing)
- **Platform Hub** — 4 hub cards: Verify Records, Transaction Log, Anchor-S4 (ILS), Systems
- **Anchor-S4 ILS** — sub-hub with 14 tool cards, each opening a full-page tool panel
- **AI Agent** — floating chat widget accessible from all ILS tools
- **Wallet** — slide-in sidebar from "My Wallet" button
- **Command Palette** — Cmd+K overlay from anywhere in workspace

> There is NO sidebar navigation. All navigation uses hub-card grids.
