---

## 1. HTML AUDIT — `index.html`

### BUG 1 — `closeOnboarding()` not exported to `window`
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **HIGH** |
| **FILE** | index.html **L310**, onboarding.js **L21** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The "Enter Platform" button at the end of the onboarding wizard calls `closeOnboarding()` via inline `onclick`. The function is defined in `onboarding.js` L21 but is **never exported** to `window` — only `onboardNext` and `selectOnboardTier` are exported (L134-135). In a Vite module build, `closeOnboarding` is module-scoped and invisible to inline handlers. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Enter platform → complete onboarding wizard to step 5. 2. Click "Enter Platform" button. 3. Console: `Uncaught ReferenceError: closeOnboarding is not defined`. |

### BUG 2 — `handleFileDrop()` not exported to `window`
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **HIGH** |
| **FILE** | index.html **L452**, metrics.js **L486** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The Anchor tab's drop zone calls `ondrop="handleFileDrop(event)"`. The function is defined in `metrics.js` L486 but **never assigned** to `window.handleFileDrop`. The `window.*` exports at the bottom of metrics.js (L1593-1603) do not include `handleFileDrop`. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Navigate to the Anchor tab. 2. Drag and drop any file onto the drop zone. 3. Console: `Uncaught ReferenceError: handleFileDrop is not defined`. The file is silently ignored. |

### BUG 3 — `handleVerifyFileDrop()` not exported to `window`
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **HIGH** |
| **FILE** | index.html **L529**, engine.js **L1151** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The Verify tab's drop zone calls `ondrop="handleVerifyFileDrop(event)"`. The function is defined in `engine.js` L1151 but is **not** in the window exports section (L8296-8428). It IS exported in `engine.ts` L8431, confirming it was missed during the JS extraction. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Navigate to the Verify tab. 2. Drag & drop a file onto the verify drop zone. 3. Console: `Uncaught ReferenceError: handleVerifyFileDrop is not defined`. |

### BUG 4 — `handleSubFileDrop()` not exported to `window`
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **HIGH** |
| **FILE** | index.html **L2236**, engine.js |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The Submissions tool's upload zone calls `ondrop="handleSubFileDrop(event)"`. This function is defined in engine.js but not present in the window exports section. It IS exported in `engine.ts` L8385, confirming it was missed. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Open Anchor-S4 → Submissions & PTD tool. 2. Drag & drop a file onto the upload zone. 3. Console: `Uncaught ReferenceError: handleSubFileDrop is not defined`. |

### BUG 5 — `loadSamplePackage()` not exported to `window`
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **HIGH** |
| **FILE** | index.html **L1001**, engine.js **L2724** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The "Load Full ILS Package" button calls `onclick="event.stopPropagation();loadSamplePackage()"`. The function is defined in engine.js L2724 but is **not** in the window exports. It IS exported in `engine.ts` L8385, confirming it was missed. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Open Anchor-S4 → Gap Analysis tool. 2. Click "Load Full ILS Package" button inside the drop zone. 3. Console: `Uncaught ReferenceError: loadSamplePackage is not defined`. |

### BUG 6 — Anchor overlay uses `display:none` but engine sets `display:flex` — popup content never centers
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **MEDIUM** |
| **FILE** | index.html **L2775**, engine.js **L716** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The `#anchorOverlay` has `style="display:none;...align-items:center;justify-content:center"` — these flex properties are set but have zero effect because the element starts as `display:none`. When `showAnchorAnimation()` fires, engine.js L716 sets `overlay.style.display = 'flex'`, which correctly activates centering. However, `hideAnchorAnimation()` at engine.js L725 sets `overlay.style.display = 'none'`. The issue: if any other code path sets the overlay visible without using `display:flex` (e.g., a hash route change or programmatic show), the popup won't center. The engine.ts version fixes this by using `classList.add('active')` / `classList.remove('active')` instead of toggling `display`, but engine.js doesn't. This is a **latent** bug — currently works in the happy path but fragile. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | Currently works in the primary flow. The fragility is architectural — no CSS class controls visibility. |

### BUG 7 — Anchor overlay lacks auto-dismiss — user must manually close
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **MEDIUM** |
| **FILE** | engine.js **L716-722** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | In `engine.js`, `showAnchorAnimation()` shows the overlay and after 2 seconds updates the text to "Anchored!", but there is no `setTimeout(hideAnchorAnimation, ...)` to auto-dismiss. The user must click outside or press the × button. The `engine.ts` version adds `setTimeout(hideAnchorAnimation, 5000)` at L734, confirming this was an intended improvement that didn't make it to engine.js. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Anchor any record. 2. Success popup stays visible indefinitely until manually dismissed. |

### BUG 8 — `session-init.js` runs before DOM is ready — potential null reference on fast loads
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **MEDIUM** |
| **FILE** | session-init.js **L7-9**, main.js **L11** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | `session-init.js` is imported 2nd in main.js (before engine.js, navigation.js, etc.) and immediately runs `document.getElementById('platformLanding').style.display = 'none'` without null-checking. If `sessionStorage.getItem('s4_entered') === '1'` is true AND the script executes before the DOM is fully parsed (possible with `type="module"` in `<head>`), the `getElementById` calls will return null, throwing `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')`. Note: The `<script type="module" src="/main.js">` is at the **bottom** of `<body>`, so in practice the DOM is available — but this is still a fragile pattern with no null guards. The `engine.js` DOMContentLoaded handler (L8237-8244) does the same re-entry check **with** null guards, making session-init.js redundant AND less safe. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | Mainly a code quality / race condition risk rather than reliably reproducible. If you move the `<script>` tag to `<head>`, it will crash. |

### BUG 9 — `_showNotif` used inline but only defined in `metrics.js` module scope
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | index.html **L147**, metrics.js **L473** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The "Forgot password?" link calls `if(typeof _showNotif==='function')_showNotif('Password reset link sent...','info')`. The `_showNotif` function IS defined in `metrics.js` L473 but is **not** exported to `window`. The `typeof` guard prevents a crash — the notification simply never fires. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Click "Forgot password?" in the login modal. 2. Nothing happens. No notification appears. (No console error due to typeof check.) |

---

## 2. ENGINE.JS AUDIT

### BUG 10 — 10 window exports present in `engine.ts` but missing from `engine.js`
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **CRITICAL** |
| **FILE** | engine.js **L8296-8428** vs engine.ts **L8296-8433** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | A diff of window exports between `engine.js` (the loaded file) and `engine.ts` (the source-of-truth) reveals these functions are exported in `.ts` but **missing** from `.js`: `handleSubFileDrop`, `handleVerifyFileDrop`, `loadSamplePackage`, `populateAllDropdowns`, `refreshVerifyRecents`, `renderHubActions`, `renderVault`, `s4ActionItems`, `s4Notify`, `_vaultPage`. Several of these are called from inline HTML handlers or referenced by other modules. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | See bugs 3/4/5 above for the inline handler crashes. For the others: `populateAllDropdowns` and `renderVault` are re-exported by enhancements.js (wrapping the original), so those specific ones work. `refreshVerifyRecents` is guarded by `typeof` checks. `renderHubActions` is called from engine.js's own DOMContentLoaded, so it works internally. But `s4ActionItems` (the raw array) and `_vaultPage` are inaccessible to external modules. |

### BUG 11 — `enterPlatform()` (engine.js L338) doesn't null-check DOM elements
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **MEDIUM** |
| **FILE** | engine.js **L338-348** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | `enterPlatform()` is exported to window and called from the "Enter Platform" button, but calls `enterPlatformAfterAuth()` which at L342-348 directly accesses `document.getElementById('platformLanding').style.display`, `document.querySelector('.hero').style.display`, and `document.getElementById('platformWorkspace').style.display` without null checks. If any element is missing or renamed, the function crashes. The `engine.ts` version wraps this in try/catch with null guards. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | Currently works because all elements exist. Would crash if any HTML structural refactoring removed these IDs. |

### BUG 12 — `s4Vault` declared with `let` at module scope (engine.js L5554) — not accessible to `navigation.js`
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **MEDIUM** |
| **FILE** | engine.js **L5554**, navigation.js **L558** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | `s4Vault` is declared as `let s4Vault` in engine.js L5554 and is **not** exported to `window` (confirmed missing from window exports). However, `navigation.js` L558 references `s4Vault.length > 0 ? s4Vault[0] : null` in the post-anchor confirmation IIFE. Since Vite bundles these as ES modules, `s4Vault` is module-scoped to engine.js and invisible to navigation.js. **However**, the `let` declaration at module top-level in a module bundle means both files share the same module scope (Vite concatenates them). If Vite does code-splitting or tree-shaking, this could break. The engine.ts exports list includes `window.s4ActionItems` and `window.s4Notify` but NOT `window.s4Vault`, making this a latent bug. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | Currently works because Vite bundles everything into one scope. Would break if modules are split. The post-anchor confirmation banner in ILS tools would fail to show vault record details. |

### BUG 13 — `_currentRole` referenced in navigation.js but defined in roles.js — implicit cross-module dependency
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | navigation.js **L205-207** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | `closeILSTool()` references `_currentRole`, `_customVisibleTabs`, `_s4Roles`, `_allHubTabs`, and `applyTabVisibility` — all defined in `roles.js`. These work because roles.js runs before navigation.js's `closeILSTool` is called (roles.js is imported after navigation.js in main.js, but these functions are only called at runtime). However, these are implicit dependencies with no `typeof` guards (unlike the `typeof applyTabVisibility === 'function'` guard on L205). If `roles.js` fails to load, `_currentRole` would be an undefined reference. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | Works in normal operation. Would throw `ReferenceError` if roles.js fails to load/parse. |

---

## 3. ENHANCEMENTS.JS AUDIT

### BUG 14 — `switchHubTab` and `openILSTool` overwritten 3 times across modules
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **MEDIUM** |
| **FILE** | engine.js (original), enhancements.js **L974**, enhancements.js **L1001**, roles.js **L465**, roles.js **L487** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The function override chain is: (1) engine.js defines `switchHubTab` and exports to `window.switchHubTab`, (2) enhancements.js L974 overwrites `window.switchHubTab` with a wrapper that adds chart refresh, (3) roles.js L487 overwrites `window.switchHubTab` again with a wrapper that adds RBAC enforcement AND calls the previous version. Same pattern for `openILSTool`. This triple-wrapping works but means each call traverses 3 function layers. More critically, if loading order changes (roles.js before enhancements.js), the RBAC wrapper would wrap the original instead of the chart-refresh version, losing chart reactivity. The load order is hard-coded in `main.js` but undocumented. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | Not a crash bug — manifests as subtle behavior differences if load order changes. Verify by adding `console.log` to each wrapper and observing call stack depth. |

### BUG 15 — `calcCompliance` overwritten in enhancements.js but engine.js also defines it
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | enhancements.js **L1380** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | `window.calcCompliance` is reassigned at enhancements.js L1380, replacing engine.js's original. The enhancement version adds workspace-activity-aware scoring. This is intentional but means the original engine.js `calcCompliance` (which is exported at L8302) is dead code — it runs briefly at page load before enhancements.js overwrites it. No correctness bug, but wasted bytes and confusing for maintainers. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | N/A — behavioral, not a crash. |

### BUG 16 — `calcROI` overwritten by both `enhancements.js` AND `roles.js`
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | enhancements.js **L3151**, roles.js **L460** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | `calcROI` is: (1) defined in engine.js and exported to window, (2) wrapped in enhancements.js L3151 with debounce, (3) completely replaced in roles.js L460 with `_bpCalcROI` (Business Process ROI). The roles.js replacement does NOT call the original, meaning the enhancements.js debounce wrapper is discarded. If `_bpCalcROI` is slower, it runs without debounce protection. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Open ROI Calculator. 2. Type rapidly in input fields. 3. `_bpCalcROI` executes on every keystroke without debounce. Minor perf issue on fast typing. |

---

## 4. NAVIGATION.JS AUDIT

### BUG 17 — `hideAnchorAnimation` captured at IIFE parse time — may capture `undefined`
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **MEDIUM** |
| **FILE** | navigation.js **L547** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The post-anchor confirmation IIFE at L546-592 executes `var _origHideAnchor = hideAnchorAnimation;` at parse time. `hideAnchorAnimation` is defined in engine.js and exported to `window.hideAnchorAnimation`. Import order in main.js: engine.js (L17) → navigation.js (L29). ES module execution order means engine.js runs first, so `hideAnchorAnimation` should be available. **However**, the reference is to the bare name `hideAnchorAnimation`, not `window.hideAnchorAnimation`. In Vite's module bundle, this works if they share scope. But the IIFE then does `hideAnchorAnimation = function() { ... }` (L548), which reassigns the **local** module-scope variable — it does NOT reassign `window.hideAnchorAnimation`. So the override only works for callers that use the module-scope reference, not for inline `onclick="hideAnchorAnimation()"` handlers that go through `window`. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Open any ILS tool. 2. Anchor a record. 3. Click × or click outside to dismiss overlay. 4. The post-anchor confirmation banner DOES appear (because engine.js internally calls the module-scope `hideAnchorAnimation`). 5. BUT if you click the × button on the overlay (which uses `onclick="hideAnchorAnimation()"`), it goes through `window.hideAnchorAnimation` which is the ORIGINAL unpatched version — no confirmation banner appears. **Inconsistent behavior depending on how the overlay is dismissed.** |

### BUG 18 — `showSection('sectionILS')` doesn't match any tab pane ID
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | navigation.js **L40-92** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | `showSection(sectionId)` uses `tabMap` to translate section IDs to tab pane IDs: `sectionILS → tabILS`. This works. However, the comment at L40 says `sectionAnchor → tabAnchor`, but there's no hub card with `onclick="showSection('sectionAnchor')"` — the Anchor section is only reachable via the hidden Bootstrap pill tab or the demoPanel buttons. This isn't a bug per se, but it means the Anchor tab has no hub card — a user who goes "Back" to the hub has no way to return to Anchor except via the tab strip (which is hidden). |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Enter platform. 2. Navigate to Anchor tab (via any method). 3. Click "Back" to return to hub. 4. No hub card exists for "Anchor" — can only return via hidden tab nav or demo panel buttons. |

---

## 5. CSS AUDIT — `main.css`

### BUG 19 — `.ils-hub-tabs` has `display:none!important` — overridden by inline `style="display:flex;"`
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | main.css **L340** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | `.ils-hub-tabs { display:none!important }` is set in CSS. The HTML at L777 uses `style="display:flex;"` — but `!important` in CSS **should** override inline styles. In practice, browsers give `!important` on a stylesheet rule higher priority than non-!important inline styles, meaning the ILS hub tabs should be hidden. However, they're visible in the app, which suggests either: (a) JavaScript is re-setting the display after load, or (b) the Vite build reorders/strips the `!important`. This deserves investigation — if the CSS `!important` is actually winning, the hub tabs are hidden and users can't navigate between ILS tools via the tab strip. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Open Anchor-S4 section. 2. Check if the horizontal tab strip (Gap Analysis, DMSMS, Readiness, etc.) is visible. 3. If hidden, users can only navigate via the tool card grid, not the tab strip. Inspect element: check computed `display` on `.ils-hub-tabs`. |

### BUG 20 — Duplicate `.hub-tool-header h4` rules at L363 and L693 with different specificity
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | main.css **L363**, **L693**, **L995** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | Three separate rules target the tool header h4: (1) `.ils-hub-panel .hub-tool-header h4` at L363 (more specific, sets color/size), (2) `.hub-tool-header h4` at L693 (less specific, sets different values), (3) `.hub-tool-header h4` at L995 in a `@media (max-width:768px)` block. The L363 rule will always win over L693 due to higher specificity, making L693 dead code for elements inside `.ils-hub-panel`. Any tool header NOT inside `.ils-hub-panel` would get L693's styles. This isn't wrong but is confusing — the two rules set different `font-size` and `color` values. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | Inspect any ILS tool panel's h4 — computed styles come from L363, not L693. Non-ILS headers (if any) would differ. |

### BUG 21 — `@media print` styles at L1020-1048 hide critical elements but don't hide modals
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | main.css **L1020-1048** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | Print styles hide `.site-footer`, `nav`, `.ai-float-wrapper`, `.wallet-sidebar`, etc. But they don't hide modal overlays (`#sendModal`, `#meetingModal`, `#actionItemModal`, `#prodFeaturesModal`). If a user prints while a modal is open, the modal's dark backdrop will obscure the page content. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Open any modal (e.g., click "Send Analysis"). 2. Press Ctrl+P / Cmd+P. 3. Print preview shows the dark overlay covering the page. |

### BUG 22 — Light mode missing styles for ILS tool panels, compliance sections, and risk engine
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **MEDIUM** |
| **FILE** | main.css **L1050-1092** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The `body.light-mode` overrides section (L1050-1092) covers nav, hero, card, stat-strip, modal, and a few other elements. But it does NOT provide overrides for: `.ils-hub-panel` backgrounds, `.ils-tool-card` backgrounds, `.ai-chat-header`, `.ai-msg`, `.vault-stats`, `.severity-*` badges, `.doc-filter-bar`, `.ils-dropzone`, calendar grid, or compliance scorecard sections. Many of these use hardcoded dark-mode colors like `background:#0a0e1a`, `color:#fff`, `border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` set via **inline styles** in HTML. These inline styles can't be overridden by CSS light-mode rules without `!important`, making large portions of the ILS tools unreadable in light mode (dark text on dark inputs, invisible borders). |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Click the sun/moon theme toggle in the nav bar. 2. Open any ILS tool (e.g., Readiness Calculator). 3. Input fields have `background:#0a0e1a` (nearly black) with `color:#fff` (white text) — these are inline styles that don't change in light mode. The surrounding card background becomes light, making it look broken. |

---

## 6. CROSS-MODULE / ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES

### BUG 23 — `showOnboarding` not exported to `window` — cannot be triggered externally
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | onboarding.js **L14** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | `showOnboarding()` is defined at L14 and called internally by the DOMContentLoaded handler at L126. It is NOT exported to `window`. If any other module or future feature needs to re-trigger the onboarding wizard (e.g., a "Show Tutorial" button), it cannot. Currently no HTML element calls it directly, so no crash — but it limits extensibility. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | Type `showOnboarding()` in the console → `ReferenceError`. |

### BUG 24 — `refreshVerifyRecents()` called conditionally from HTML (L510) but not exported
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | index.html **L510**, engine.js **L1022** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | The Verify tab's "Refresh" button calls `onclick="resetVerify();if(typeof refreshVerifyRecents==='function')refreshVerifyRecents();"`. The `typeof` guard prevents a crash, but `refreshVerifyRecents` is NOT exported to `window` from engine.js. So the guard always evaluates to `false` and the recently-anchored records list is never refreshed when the user clicks Refresh. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | 1. Anchor several records. 2. Go to Verify tab. 3. Click the "Refresh" button. 4. `resetVerify()` clears fields, but `refreshVerifyRecents()` never runs — the "Recently Anchored" list is stale. |

### BUG 25 — `calEventDate` element referenced in engine.js DOMContentLoaded but doesn't exist in HTML
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **SEVERITY** | **LOW** |
| **FILE** | engine.js **L8250** |
| **DESCRIPTION** | Engine.js DOMContentLoaded at L8250 does `const calDate = document.getElementById('calEventDate'); if (calDate) calDate.value = ...`. The ID `calEventDate` does NOT exist in index.html (confirmed by grep). The null check prevents a crash, but this is dead code referencing a removed element. The calendar in the Action Items panel uses `actionCalendarGrid` and `calDayDetail` — no `calEventDate` input exists. |
| **REPRODUCTION** | No visible bug — null check prevents crash. Dead code only. |
