# S4 Ledger — Security Policy

## Architecture: Hash-Only, Zero Data On-Chain

S4 Ledger anchors **only SHA-256 hashes** to the XRP Ledger. No documents, filenames, part numbers, serial numbers, PII, CUI, or classified information ever touches the blockchain.

A SHA-256 hash is a one-way mathematical fingerprint. It **cannot be reversed** to recover the original data. Even knowing the hash, an attacker cannot determine what was hashed.

### What goes on-chain
- 64-character SHA-256 hash string
- XRPL transaction metadata (timestamp, fee, memo field)

### What never goes on-chain
- Original documents, files, or records
- Part numbers, NSNs, serial numbers
- Personnel names, SSNs, or PII
- Contract numbers or dollar amounts
- Classified or CUI-marked data
- Any identifiable defense information

---

## SHA-256 Security

- **Collision resistance:** No two different inputs have ever been found to produce the same SHA-256 hash. The probability is approximately 1 in 2^128 — computationally infeasible.
- **Pre-image resistance:** Given a hash, it is computationally infeasible to find the original input.
- **NIST approved:** SHA-256 is approved by NIST (FIPS 180-4) for federal information processing.
- **Industry standard:** Used by Bitcoin, TLS certificates, code signing, and DoW systems.

---

## XRP Ledger Security

- **Consensus:** XRPL uses the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol (not proof-of-work or proof-of-stake). Validators agree on transaction ordering without mining.
- **Decentralized:** 150+ validators operated by universities, exchanges, and independent operators worldwide.
- **Uptime:** 99.99%+ since 2012. No rollbacks, no chain reversals.
- **Finality:** Transactions are final in 3-5 seconds. Once anchored, a hash cannot be altered or removed.
- **Immutability:** Ledger history is cryptographically linked. Altering a past transaction would require rewriting the entire chain — computationally impossible.

---

## SDK Security

- **TLS 1.3:** All connections to XRPL nodes use TLS 1.3 encryption
- **Key management:** Wallet seeds are never stored by S4 Ledger servers. Keys remain with the user.
- **No telemetry:** The SDK does not phone home, collect analytics, or transmit usage data
- **Open source:** Full source code available for audit
- **Dependency management:** Minimal dependencies — `xrpl-py` and `cryptography` (both audited, widely-used libraries)
- **Input validation:** All inputs are sanitized before hashing. Invalid data types are rejected.

## Compliance Alignment

| Control Framework | S4 Ledger Alignment |
|---|---|
| **NIST 800-171** | Zero CUI on-chain. Hash-only architecture ensures no controlled unclassified information is exposed. |
| **CMMC Level 2+** | S4 Systems, LLC is pursuing CMMC Level 2 certification. S4 Ledger architecture is CMMC-aligned and supplements existing controls with integrity verification. |
| **DFARS 252.204-7012** | No covered defense information is stored, processed, or transmitted on-chain. |
| **NIST 800-53 (AU family)** | Provides immutable audit trail (AU-3, AU-6, AU-10, AU-11). |
| **FedRAMP** | Planned for Phase 5 roadmap. |

## Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Data exfiltration via blockchain | Impossible — only irreversible hashes are stored |
| Hash collision (fake record passes verification) | SHA-256 collision probability: ~1 in 2^128 |
| XRPL ledger tampering | Requires compromising 80%+ of validators simultaneously |
| Man-in-the-middle on SDK calls | TLS 1.3 encryption on all XRPL connections |
| Wallet compromise | Users control their own keys; S4 Ledger never stores seeds |
| Supply chain attack on SDK | Minimal dependencies, pinned versions, hash-verified packages |

---

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability in S4 Ledger:

1. **Email:** security@s4ledger.com
2. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
3. **Include:** Description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, potential impact
4. **Response time:** We will acknowledge within 48 hours and provide a resolution timeline within 7 days

We follow coordinated disclosure practices. Reporters will be credited unless they request anonymity.

---

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. Affected services are isolated immediately
2. Impact assessment within 4 hours
3. User notification within 24 hours if data is affected
4. Post-incident report published within 30 days
5. Remediation deployed and verified

---

## Security API Endpoints

S4 Ledger exposes 5 security-specific API endpoints for programmatic access:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/security/audit-trail` | GET | AI + verification audit trail (hashed, timestamped entries) |
| `/api/security/rbac` | GET/POST | RBAC role management — 5 roles: Admin, Analyst, Auditor, Operator, Viewer |
| `/api/security/zkp` | GET/POST | Zero-Knowledge Proof generation & verification (Pedersen commitments (v5.2); Bulletproofs/Groth16 planned) |
| `/api/security/threat-model` | GET | STRIDE + NIST SP 800-161 threat model with compliance mapping |
| `/api/security/dependency-audit` | GET | Dependency audit with CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM, safety/pip-audit/bandit/semgrep scans |

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)

ZKP allows third parties to verify a record was correctly anchored **without revealing the underlying data**. Critical for:
- CUI/ITAR compliance where verifiers cannot access content
- Cross-organization auditing without data exposure
- Supply chain integrity proof without logistics data disclosure

Current: Enhanced ZKP with Pedersen commitments (v5.2). Production target: Bulletproofs/Groth16.

### RBAC / Access Control

| Role | Permissions | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | Full platform access (`*`) | Enterprise |
| Analyst | Anchor, verify, ILS, AI query, metrics, export | Professional |
| Auditor | Verify, metrics, audit trail, security (read-only) | Professional |
| Operator | Anchor, verify, offline sync | Starter |
| Viewer | Verify, metrics (read-only) | Pilot |

MFA (multi-factor authentication) planned for future release.

### AI Audit Trail

Every AI response is:
1. SHA-256 hashed immediately
2. Logged with query, intent, entities, timestamp
3. Verifiable via `POST /api/verify/ai` with the response hash
4. Optionally anchored to XRPL for immutable AI decision provenance

### Dependency Auditing

- **Tools:** `safety`, `pip-audit`, `bandit`, `semgrep`
- **SBOM format:** CycloneDX 1.5
- **Scan cadence:** Monthly (automated)
- **API access:** `GET /api/security/dependency-audit`

### Threat Modeling

STRIDE-based threat model accessible via `GET /api/security/threat-model`:
- Maps all platform components (API gateway, XRPL anchoring, AI engine, supply chain data, offline queue, user auth)
- NIST SP 800-161 control recommendations
- CMMC Level 2, NIST 800-171, DFARS 252.204-7012 compliance scoring
- Residual risk categorization per component

- Unique export hash generated per document
- Session ID for audit attribution
- Blockchain network reference (XRP Ledger Mainnet)
- Verification URL for independent integrity checking
