## What Is SLS?

SLS (Secure Logistics Standard) is the utility token that powers S4 Ledger. Every time a defense record is "anchored" (stamped) to the XRP Ledger, it costs 0.01 SLS. Think of SLS like postage stamps — they're consumed when you use the service.

SLS is **not** an investment, equity, security, or speculative asset. It's fuel.

## The Three Wallets

S4 Ledger uses three XRPL wallets, each with a distinct role:

| Wallet | Address | Role | Who Controls It |
|--------|---------|------|-----------------|
| **Issuer** | `r95G...TA5` | Created the 100M SLS supply. Signs anchor transactions (fingerprints on-chain). | S4 Systems |
| **Treasury** | `rMLm...KLqJ` | Holds XRP + SLS reserves. Funds new user wallets. Delivers SLS to subscribers. Collects anchor fees. | S4 Systems (automated) |
| **Ops** | `raWL...un51` | Nick's personal operating wallet. **Not involved in SLS economy at all.** | Nick Frankfort |

## How the Economy Works

### Step 1: Customer Signs Up

A customer subscribes to S4 Ledger (e.g., Starter at $999/month).

- S4 pockets the $999 as **revenue**
- The Treasury wallet automatically:
  1. Creates a new XRPL wallet for the customer
  2. Sends **12 XRP** to activate it (XRPL reserve requirement)
  3. Sets up an SLS TrustLine
  4. Delivers the plan's SLS allocation (e.g., 25,000 SLS for Starter)

The 12 XRP is a **business expense** absorbed from subscription revenue. At current XRP prices (~$2.50), that's ~$30 per signup against $999/month revenue.

### Step 2: Customer Uses the Platform

Every time the customer anchors a record (stamps a fingerprint to the blockchain):

- Their wallet automatically sends **0.01 SLS** → Treasury
- The Issuer wallet signs the anchor transaction (memo on-chain)
- The customer sees a transaction hash and explorer link

This is **fully automatic** — no manual action by anyone. The customer's wallet seed is stored securely (custodial model, like Coinbase) and the fee is deducted on their behalf.

### Step 3: Monthly Renewal

When Stripe processes the next month's payment:

- A webhook fires to our API
- Treasury sends the next month's SLS allocation to the customer's wallet
- The customer can keep anchoring immediately

### Step 4: The Cycle Continues

```
Treasury ──→ User Wallet ──→ Treasury ──→ User Wallet ──→ ...
  (SLS)       (anchoring)      (fees)      (renewal)
```

SLS flows in a circle: Treasury → User → Treasury → User. The supply is **self-sustaining** because every SLS that goes out (delivery) eventually comes back (anchor fees).

## Revenue Model

| Revenue Source | Amount | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Subscription fee | $999–$9,999/mo | **S4 keeps 100% as revenue** |
| XRP activation cost | ~$30 per signup | Business expense (12 XRP × ~$2.50) |
| SLS delivery cost | $0 | SLS is our own token — no cost to deliver |

**Net per Starter signup:** $999 revenue − $30 XRP cost = **$969/month profit margin**

The only real cost is the 12 XRP activation per new user. Everything else is pure margin.

## Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Price | SLS/Month | Max Anchors | Target Customer |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Pilot | Free | 100 | 10,000 | Evaluators, demos |
| Starter | $999/mo | 25,000 | 2,500,000 | Contractors, depot maintenance |
| Professional | $2,499/mo | 100,000 | 10,000,000 | Program offices, fleet sustainment |
| Enterprise | $9,999/mo | 500,000 | Unlimited | DoD agencies, OEMs |

## Why This Model Works

### 1. Zero Friction for Customers
Customers never deal with cryptocurrency. They pay a subscription in USD, and everything else (wallet creation, SLS delivery, anchor fees) happens automatically behind the scenes.

### 2. Circular Economy
SLS flows Treasury → User → Treasury. The token supply is not consumed — it circulates. As long as customers are anchoring records, SLS flows back to Treasury for re-distribution.

### 3. Minimal Ongoing Cost
- SLS delivery: Free (it's our token)
- XRP per anchor: ~12 drops (~$0.000003) per transaction — negligible
- The only material cost is the one-time 12 XRP activation per user

### 4. Regulatory Simplicity
SLS is delivered as part of a subscription service, consumed as fuel, and returns to the Treasury. There is no "purchase" of a token, no exchange, no secondary market expectation. This significantly simplifies SEC/FinCEN compliance.

## Treasury Management

The Treasury wallet needs to maintain reserves of:

1. **XRP** — For activating new user wallets (12 XRP each) and covering transaction fees (~12 drops each)
2. **SLS** — For delivering monthly allocations to subscribers

### XRP Replenishment
Treasury XRP is a business expense. As signups consume the XRP reserve, S4 periodically tops it off by purchasing XRP on an exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, Uphold) and sending it to the Treasury address. See `XRP_TOPOFF_FORECAST.md` for projections.

### SLS Replenishment
Because of the circular economy (fees come back), the SLS reserve is largely self-sustaining. However, for growth periods with many new signups, the Issuer can send additional SLS to Treasury from the total 100M supply.

## Environment Variables Required

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `XRPL_WALLET_SEED` | Issuer wallet — signs anchor transactions |
| `XRPL_TREASURY_SEED` | Treasury wallet — funds users, delivers SLS, collects fees |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Server-side Supabase access for storing custodial wallet seeds |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Verifies incoming Stripe webhook signatures |

These are set in Vercel environment variables. The Ops wallet seed is **never** stored in the application.

---

## Key Takeaway

The SLS economy is a simple, self-sustaining circle. Customers pay subscriptions (our revenue), receive SLS (our token, zero cost to deliver), spend SLS on anchoring (fees return to Treasury), and get refilled each month. The only real cost per customer is ~$30 of XRP for wallet activation — a one-time expense against recurring monthly revenue.
