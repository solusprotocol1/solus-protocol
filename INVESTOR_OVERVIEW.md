# S4 Ledger: Investor & Grant Overview

## Why Invest in S4 Ledger?

- **$1.2B+ Problem:** Counterfeit parts, falsified maintenance records, and unverifiable supply chains cost the DoD billions annually. S4 Ledger fixes this with blockchain-secured, tamper-proof logistics verification.
- **Unique Approach:** Anchors only SHA-256 hashes (never sensitive data) to the XRP Ledger — zero data on-chain, full compliance with NIST/CMMC.
- **Traction:** Live $SLS token on XRPL mainnet, working Python SDK, defense use case library, and a clear path to pilot deployments.
- **Market:** Defense logistics verification is underserved. $800B+ annual DoD budget with no common integrity layer across systems.
- **Revenue Model:** SaaS subscriptions for defense contractors, $SLS utility fees per anchor, enterprise API tiers.
- **Compliance:** Designed for NIST 800-171, CMMC Level 2+, DFARS 252.204-7012. $SLS is a utility token — not a security.
- **Team:** Built by ILS professionals with years of hands-on experience across Navy and DoD programs.
