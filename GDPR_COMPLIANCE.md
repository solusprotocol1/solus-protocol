# GDPR Compliance Notes

S4 Ledger is designed to support GDPR compliance for international and NATO ally partners:
- No personal data is stored on-chain; only SHA-256 hashes are anchored.
- All sensitive data remains off-chain within the partner's infrastructure.
- Data subjects can request deletion of off-chain records.
- Partners must ensure local storage and processing comply with GDPR.
- Hash-only architecture ensures no PII crosses international boundaries via the blockchain.
