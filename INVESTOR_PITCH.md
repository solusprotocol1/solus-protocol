# Solus Protocol: Investor Pitch

## Vision
Solus Protocol is building the future of secure, compliant, and interoperable medical data—anchored on the XRPL and powered by the $SLS utility token.

## Problem & Opportunity
- $300B+ lost annually to healthcare data silos, errors, and inefficiencies
- Existing solutions lack compliance, auditability, and real-world integration
- Solus anchors only SHA-256 hashes (never PHI) to XRPL for privacy, compliance, and real-time audit

## Traction
- $SLS token is live on the XRPL mainnet
- South Carolina pilot partners and a working SDK
- HIPAA-ready, open-source, and transparent
- Product roadmap with clear milestones (see below)

## Market
- Blockchain healthcare market: $11B (2024) → $200B+ (2030), 60%+ CAGR
- SaaS subscriptions, $SLS utility fees, and network incentives

## Roadmap & Milestones
- Q1 2026: Partner onboarding automation, SDK docs, multi-language SDKs, compliance modules, audit dashboard
- Q2 2026: Mobile SDK, advanced encryption, cross-chain anchoring, fiat expansion, EHR partnerships
- Q3 2026: Mainnet launch, AI anomaly detection, global partners, developer hackathon

## Tokenomics & Governance
- 100M $SLS: 60% public, 15% ecosystem, 15% team, 10% reserves (DAO)
  - Utility token (not a security), with legal review for SEC/CFTC compliance

## Team & Partners
- Founder: Nick Frankfort (blockchain, healthcare, compliance)
- Advisors: Healthcare, blockchain, and compliance experts
- Partners: XRPL Community, South Carolina pilot clinics
