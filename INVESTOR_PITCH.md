# S4 Ledger: Investor Pitch

## Vision

S4 Ledger is building the integrity layer for defense logistics — immutable verification of supply chains, maintenance records, technical data, and contract deliverables, anchored on the XRPL and powered by the $SLS utility token.

## Problem & Opportunity

- Counterfeit parts in DoD supply chains cost billions and endanger warfighters
- Gundecked maintenance records undermine readiness across all service branches
- CDRL delivery disputes consume months of contract resolution time
- No common integrity layer exists across GCSS, DPAS, 3-M, and contractor ERPs
- Current solutions are siloed, unverifiable, and expensive

## Solution

- Anchor only SHA-256 hashes (never sensitive data) to the XRP Ledger
- Zero data on-chain — full NIST/CMMC compliance
- 3-5 second confirmation, ~$0.001 per anchor
- Python SDK integrates in 10 lines of code

## Traction

- $SLS token live on XRPL mainnet (issuer: r95GyZac4butvVcsTWUPpxzekmyzaHsTA5)
- 30M SLS in multi-sig treasury
- Working SDK with defense use case library
- 9-page website at s4ledger.com
- Open-source and auditable

## Market

- $800B+ annual DoD budget
- 12 ILS elements (MIL-STD-1388) — each an addressable market
- No competitor combines hash-only architecture + public ledger + defense focus
- Adjacent markets: NATO allies, defense contractors, shipbuilding, aviation MRO

## Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Foundation | Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 ✅ | SDK, $SLS token, website |
| Defense Platform | Q1 – Q2 2026 🔄 | Use case library, compliance docs, partnerships |
| MVP & Pilot | Q3 – Q4 2026 | Internal pilot on real contract data |
| Partner & SaaS | Q1 – Q2 2027 | REST API, SaaS dashboard, DIU/NavalX |
| Scale & Certify | Q3 2027+ | NIST, FedRAMP, production deployments |

## Tokenomics

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Public circulation | 30,000,000 SLS | Market liquidity |
| Operating treasury | 30,000,000 SLS | Platform operations (multi-sig) |
| Development reserve | 20,000,000 SLS | Team, advisors |
| Ecosystem incentives | 20,000,000 SLS | Early adopter grants, pilots |

$SLS is a utility token — not equity or a security.

## Ask

Seeking strategic investment and partnership for:
- SBIR/STTR applications (Navy, DIU)
- Pilot program with real contract data
- Product development (REST API, SaaS dashboard, batch operations)
